Introduction\\nThe ubiquitous deployment of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) results in ever-growing amounts of compute spent\\non inference (Patterson et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Kad-\\ndour et al., 2023a; Xia et al., 2024; Reid et al., 2024). Fur-\\nther, serving models with low latencies remains challenging\\nbecause contemporary Transformer architectures employ\\nthe self-attention mechanism with quadratic input complex-\\nity (Touvron et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we delve deeper into the concept of layer\\nskipping (Fan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022a) to reduce\\nthe computation on superfluous LLM components.

Layer skipping\\nConsider a Transformer model M with L layers, each\\nconsisting of an attention sub-layer followed by a multi-\\nlayer perceptron (MLP) sub-layer. We denote each layer as\\nMi = (Attentioni, MLPi) for i ∈{1, 2, . . . , L}.\\nTo compare the performance of Transformer models when\\nskipping specific sub-layers, we create two variants of the\\nmodel:\\n1. Skipping MLP Layers: We construct a model Mskip MLP\\n1\\narXiv:2407.15516v1  [cs.LG]  22 Jul 2024\\nAttention Is All You Need But You Don’t Need All Of It\\nby skipping the MLP sub-layer from the last k layers. The\\nresulting model is Mskip MLP = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(Attentioni, ∅) | i ∈{L −k +\\n1, . . . , L}}.\\n2.

Skip mechanisms for skipping single layers and entire\\nTransformer blocks (ffwd and attention layers) during inference.\\n2.2. Motivation: Are Deeper Layers More Redundant?\\nIn Transformer models, the last layers have been shown to\\ncontribute less information than earlier layers, making it\\npossible to drop those layers at a minimal performance cost\\n(Fan et al., 2019; Zhang & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022a;\\nSchuster et al., 2022; Kaddour et al., 2023b; Belrose et al.,\\n2023).\\nTo verify this, we experiment with removing either the at-\\ntention sublayers or the MLP sublayers. Figure 1 shows the\\ncosine similarities between a layer’s features and the previ-\\nous layer showing that deeper layers have a lower impact\\non the features than earlier layers. One notable exception\\nto this trend is that the last layer for both Llama-v2 7B and\\n13B has the lowest cosine similarity with the previous layer.\\nPrevious analysis of the attention mechanism has shown\\nthat they can converge to the same value due to attention\\ncollapse (Zhai et al., 2023) and token features that also con-\\nverge to the same value due to over-smoothing (Wang et al.,\\n2022b; Dovonon et al., 2024) or rank collapse (Dong et al.,\\n2023), with solutions to these issues typically improving\\nperformance (Ali et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2024).\\n3. Results\\nExperimental Setup\\nFor all experiments, we use either\\nLlama-v2-7B or Llama-v2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a;b),\\ntwo LLMs trained on trillions of publically available tokens.\\nWe experiment with keeping 66%, 75%, 90% and 100% of\\nthe network and report the corresponding results in Table 1.\\nWe also experiment with removing attention sublayers in\\nTable 2, MLP sublayers in Table 3, and a varying number of\\nlayers similar to Table 1 but keeping the last layer in Table 4.\\n3.1.

This is even more\\nexaggerated compared to just dropping layers, including the\\nlast one. The reason for this could be attributed to the (lack\\nof) robustness of feedforward sublayers, as the last layer\\nnow has to process perturbed information from earlier lay-\\ners. For future work, it would be interesting to see if these\\nperformance drops can be compensated by a small amount\\nTable 5.

Related Work\\nEarly Exit during inference\\nEarly exit methods have also\\nbeen proposed in other domains (Graves, 2017; Teerapit-\\ntayanon et al., 2017) before getting adapted to autoregressive\\nmodels (Elbayad et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2022; Din et al.,\\n2023; Elhoushi et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\\n2024). The idea works by dynamically allocating compute\\nbased on the difficulty of the input sequence. Our method\\nprunes the deepest layers and does not involve any level of\\nadaptability. This is beneficial because it does not require\\nthe entire model to be loaded in memory. Dropping layers\\nduring inference has been done on BERT-like models in\\n(Wang et al., 2022a; Sajjad et al., 2023). We apply a similar\\nanalysis to more recent LLMs and study the impact of skip-\\nping attention and/or MLP layers in more detail. Concurrent\\nwork to ours by Gromov et al. (2024) yields similar results\\nby pruning deeper layers and applying fine-tuning on the\\npruned model.\\nLayer dropping/growing during training\\nThere are var-\\nious works studying the dropping/growing layers dynami-\\ncally during training (Fan et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019;\\nKaddour et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). In\\ncontrast, this work focuses on dropping layers of an already\\npre-trained model in a way similar to Men et al. (2024).\\nOther Inference Speedup Methods\\nOther works to speed\\nup inference include compressing KV caches (Nawrot et al.,\\n2024; Wu & Tu, 2024; Bi et al., 2024), speculative decoding\\n(Chen et al., 2023), efficient memory management (Kwon\\net al., 2023), or subqudratic attention architectures (Fu et al.,\\n2022; Peng et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2023), an overview has\\nbeen provided by Kaddour et al. (2023a).\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe investigated the effect of dropping the last layers from\\nthe 7B and 13B Llama2 models. We observe that dropping\\nattention sublayers lead to much lower drops in performance\\nthan dropping the MLP sublayers, whether the last layer\\nis included or not, while also leading to better inference\\nspeedups. For example, removing 33% of attention layers\\nleads to an 18% speedup in a 13B Llama2 model at the cost\\nof a 1.8% drop in average performance. This shows that\\nmassive improvements can be made over dropping entire\\nlayers from just dropping the attention sublayer.\\nReferences\\nAli, A., Galanti, T., and Wolf, L.

Introduction\\nInstance-level image retrieval is at the core of visual rep-\\nresentation learning and is connected with many problems\\nof visual recognition and machine learning, for instance\\nmetric learning [30, 26], few-shot learning [42] and unsu-\\npervised learning [8]. Many large-scale open datasets [3,\\n37, 16, 29, 53], and competitions1 have accelerated progress\\nin instance-level image retrieval, which has been trans-\\nformed by deep learning [3].\\nMany studies on instance-level image retrieval focus\\non learning features from convolutional neural networks\\n(CNN), while others focus on re-ranking, for instance by\\ngraph-based methods [11]. The former can be distinguished\\naccording to feature types: local descriptors, reminiscent of\\nSIFT [27], where an image is mapped to a few hundred vec-\\ntors; and global descriptors, where an image is mapped to a\\n1https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020\\nsingle vector. In fact, deep learning has brought global de-\\nscriptors with astounding performance, while allowing efﬁ-\\ncient search. Our study belongs to this type.\\nStudies on global descriptors have focused on spatial\\npooling [2, 37]. The need for compact, discriminative rep-\\nresentations that are resistant to clutter has naturally given\\nrise to spatial attention methods [24, 28]. Different kinds\\nof attention have been studied in many areas of computer\\nvision research. There is also channel attention [20, 9]; lo-\\ncal attention, applied independently to elements of the rep-\\nresentation (feature map) [54, 25]; global attention, based\\non interaction between elements [52, 9]; and combinations\\nthereof. Unfortunately, each study has been limited to one or\\ntwo kinds of attention only; attention is not always learned;\\nand applications vary.\\nIt is the objective of our work to perform a compre-\\nhensive study of all forms of attention above, apply them\\nto instance-level image retrieval and provide a detailed ac-\\ncount of their interaction and impact on performance. As\\nshown in Figure 1, we collect contextual information from\\nimages with both local and global attention, giving rise to\\ntwo parallel network streams. Importantly, each operates\\non both spatial locations and feature channels. Local at-\\ntention is about individual locations and channels; global is\\nabout interaction between locations and between channels.\\nThe extracted information is separately embedded in local\\nand global attention feature maps, which are combined in a\\nglobal-local attention feature map before pooling.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We propose a novel network that consists of both\\nglobal and local attention for image retrieval. This is\\nthe ﬁrst study that employs both mechanisms.\\n2. Each of the global and local attention mechanisms\\ncomprises both spatial and channel attention.\\n3. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical\\nevidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and\\nimprove the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n1\\narXiv:2107.08000v1  [cs.CV]  16 Jul 2021\\nAl\\nc\\nc × 1 × 1\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\nc\\nAl\\ns\\n1 × h × w\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\n×\\nc × h × w\\nF\\n×\\n+\\nc × h × w\\nFgl\\nAg\\nc\\nc × c\\n×\\nFg\\nc\\nAg\\ns\\nhw × hw\\n×\\n+\\nFg\\n×\\nwl\\nw\\nwg\\nchannel attention\\nspatial attention\\nfusion\\nlocal attention\\nglobal attention\\nFigure 1: Our global-local attention module (GLAM) involves both channel and spatial attention, as well as both local atten-\\ntion (channels/locations weighted independently, based on contextual information obtained by pooling) and global attention\\n(based on pairwise interaction between channels/locations).

The input feature map F is weighted into local (Fl) and\\nglobal (Fg) attention feature maps, which are fused with F to yield the global-local attention feature map Fgl.

Related work\\nInstance-level image retrieval\\nStudies on instance-level\\nimage retrieval can be roughly, but not exclusively, di-\\nvided into three types: (1) studies on global descriptors\\n[3, 16, 24, 53, 2, 37]; (2) studies on local descriptors and\\ngeometry-based re-ranking [29, 45, 40, 53]; (3) re-ranking\\nby graph-based methods [11, 21, 55]. The ﬁrst two types\\nof studies focus on the feature representation, while the last\\ntype focuses on re-ranking extracted features.\\nStudies on global descriptors focus on spatial pooling\\nof CNN feature maps into vectors, including MAC [38],\\nSPoC [2], CroW [24], R-MAC [48, 15, 16], GeM [37],\\nand NetVLAD [1, 25], as well as learning the representa-\\ntion [3, 15, 16, 36, 37]. Studies before deep learning dom-\\ninated image retrieval were mostly based on local descrip-\\ntors like SIFT [27] and bag-of-words representation [32] or\\naggregated descriptors like VLAD [22] or ASMK [46]. Lo-\\ncal descriptors have been revived in deep learning, e.g. with\\nDELF [29], DELG [5] and ASMK extensions [45, 47].\\nWe focus on learning a global descriptor in this work, be-\\ncause it is the most efﬁcient in terms of storage and search.\\nHowever, our generic attention mechanism produces a fea-\\nture tensor and could be applicable to local descriptors as\\nwell, if global pooling were replaced by local feature detec-\\ntion. Re-ranking methods are complementary to the repre-\\nsentation and we do not consider them in this work.\\nAttention\\nAttention mechanisms have been ﬁrst proposed\\nin image classiﬁcation studies focusing on channel at-\\nMETHOD\\nLOCAL\\nGLOBAL\\nLRN RET\\nSpatial Channel Spatial Channel\\nSENet [20]\\n✓\\n✓\\nECA-Net [51]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGCNet [6]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCBAM [54]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nGE [19]\\n✓\\n✓\\nNL-Net [52]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAA-Net [4]\\n✓\\n✓\\nSAN [59]\\n✓\\n✓\\nN3Net [34]\\n✓\\n✓\\nA2-Net [9]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGSoP [14]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOnA [23]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAGeM [17]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCroW [24]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nCRN [25]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELF [29]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELG [5]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nTolias et al.

CRN [25] ap-\\nplies spatial attention for feature reweighting and is learned.\\nLearned spatial attention mechanisms are common for local\\ndescriptors [29, 5, 47].\\nWe call the above methods local attention, in the sense\\nthat elements of the feature tensor (channels / spatial loca-\\ntions), are weighted independently, based on contextual in-\\nformation obtained by pooling or learned. By constrast, by\\nglobal attention we refer to mechanisms that model inter-\\naction between elements of the feature tensor, for example\\nbetween channels or between locations.\\nIn image classiﬁcation, non-local neural network (NL-\\nNet) [52] is maybe the ﬁrst global attention mechanism, fol-\\nlowed by similar studies [4, 59, 34]. It is global spatial at-\\ntention, allowing interaction between any pair of spatial lo-\\ncations. Similarly, there are studies of global channel atten-\\ntion, allowing interaction between channels [9, 14]. Global\\nattention has focused mostly on image recognition and has\\nbeen applied to either spatial or channel attention so far, not\\nboth. In image retrieval, SOLAR [28] is a direct application\\nof the global spatial attention mechanism of [52].\\nTable 1 attempts to categorize related work on atten-\\ntion according to whether attention is local or global, spa-\\ntial or channel, whether it is learned and whether it is ap-\\nplied to instance-level image retrieval. We observe that all\\nmethods limit to one or two forms of attention only. Of\\nthose studies that focus on image retrieval, many are not\\nlearned [23, 17, 24], and of those that are, some are de-\\nsigned for local descriptors [29, 47].\\nBy contrast, we provide a comprehensive study of all\\nforms of attention, global and local, spatial and channel, to\\nobtain a learned representation in the form of a tensor that\\ncan be used in any way. We spatially pool it into a global\\ndescriptor and we study the relative gain of different forms\\nof attention in image retrieval.\\nfeature map\\nconv 1 × 1\\nconv 3 × 3\\nconv 5 × 5\\nconv 7 × 7\\nconcat\\nconv 1 × 1\\nattention map\\nc × h × w\\n4c′ × h × w\\n1 × h × w\\nc′ × h × w\\ndilated\\nconv\\nF\\nF′\\nAl\\ns\\nFigure 3: Local spatial attention.

Global-local attention\\nWe design a global-local attention module (GLAM),\\nwhich is attached at the end of a backbone network. Figure 1\\nillustrates its main components. We are given a c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F, where c is the number of channels, and\\nh × w is the spatial resolution. Local attention collects con-\\ntext from the image and applies pooling to obtain a c×1×1\\nlocal channel attention map Al\\nc and a 1 × h × w local spa-\\ntial attention map Al\\ns. Global attention allows interaction\\nbetween channels, resulting in a c × c global channel at-\\ntention map Ag\\nc, and between spatial locations, resulting in\\na hw × hw global spatial attention map Ag\\ns. The feature\\nmaps produced by the two attention streams are combined\\nwith the original one by a learned fusion mechanism into\\nthe global-local attention feature map Fgl before being spa-\\ntially pooled into a global image descriptor.\\n3.1. Local attention\\nWe extract an 1D channel and a 2D spatial attention map\\nto weigh the feature map in the corresponding dimensions.\\nLocal channel attention\\nFollowing ECA-Net [51], this\\nattention captures local channel information. As shown in\\nFigure 2, we are given a c×h×w feature tensor F from our\\nbackbone. We ﬁrst reduce it to a c × 1 × 1 tensor by global\\naverage pooling (GAP). Channel attention is then captured\\nby a 1D convolution of kernel size k along the channel di-\\nmension, where k controls the extent of cross-channel inter-\\naction. This is followed by a sigmoid function, resulting in\\nthe c × 1 × 1 local channel attention map Al\\nc.\\nLocal spatial attention\\nInspired by the inception mod-\\nule [43] and similar to [25], this attention map captures local\\nspatial information at different scales.

We then extract local spatial\\ncontextual information using convolutional ﬁlters of kernel\\nsize 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7, which are efﬁciently imple-\\nmented by 3 × 3 dilated convolutions [7, 57] with dilation\\nparameter 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The resulting features,\\nalong with one obtained by 1 × 1 convolution on F′, are\\nconcatenated into a 4c′ × h × w tensor. Finally, we obtain\\nthe 1 × h × w local spatial attention map Al\\ns by a 1 × 1\\nconvolution that reduces the channel dimension to 1.\\nThe middle column of Figure 6 shows heat maps of local\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nLocal attention feature map\\nWe use the local channel\\nattention map Al\\nc to weigh F in the channel dimension\\nFl\\nc := F ⊙Al\\nc + F.\\n(1)\\nWe then use local spatial attention map Al\\ns to weigh Fl\\nc\\nin the spatial dimensions, resulting in the c × h × w local\\nattention feature map\\nFl = Fl\\nc ⊙Al\\ns + Fl\\nc.\\n(2)\\nHere, A⊙B denotes an element-wise multiplication of ten-\\nsors A and B, with broadcasting when one tensor is smaller.\\nWe adopt the choice of applying channel followed by spa-\\ntial attention from convolutional block attention module\\nCBAM [54]. However, apart from computing Al\\ns at differ-\\nent scales, both attention maps are obtained from the orig-\\ninal tensor F rather than sequentially. In addition, both (1)\\nand (2) include residual connections, while CBAM includes\\na single residual connection over both steps.\\n3.2.

This mechanism is based on the non-local neural net-\\nwork [52], but with the idea of 1D convolution from ECA-\\nNet [51]. As shown in Figure 4, we are given the c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F from our backbone. We apply GAP and\\nsqueeze spatial dimensions, followed by a 1D convolution\\nof kernel size k and a sigmoid function, to obtain 1×c query\\nQc and key Kc tensors. The value tensor Vc is obtained by\\nmere reshaping of F to hw×c, without GAP. Next, we form\\nthe outer product of Kc and Qc, followed by softmax over\\nchannels to obtain a c × c global channel attention map\\nAg\\nc = softmax(Kc\\n⊤Qc).\\n(3)\\nFinally, this attention map is multiplied with Vc and the ma-\\ntrix product VcAg\\nc is reshaped back to c×h×w to give the\\nglobal channel attention feature map Gc. In GSoP [14] and\\nA2-Net [9], a c×c global channel attention map is obtained\\nby multiplication of hw × c matrices; (3) is more efﬁcient,\\nusing only an outer product of 1 × c vectors.\\nGlobal spatial attention\\nSince ordinary convolution ap-\\nplies only a local neighborhood at a time, it cannot capture\\nglobal contextual information. Thus, we apply non-local ﬁl-\\ntering [52], which is a form of self-attention [49] in the spa-\\ntial dimensions. As shown in Figure 5, we are given the\\nsame c × h × w feature tensor F from our backbone. By\\nusing three 1×1 convolutions, which reduce channels to c′,\\nand ﬂattening spatial dimensions to hw, we obtain c′ × hw\\nquery Qs, key Ks, and value Vs tensors, where each col-\\numn is a feature vector corresponding to a particular spatial\\nlocation. We capture pairwise similarities of these vectors\\nby matrix multiplication of Ks and Qs, followed by soft-\\nmax over locations to obtain a hw × hw global spatial at-\\ntention map:\\nAg\\ns = softmax(K⊤\\ns Qs).\\n(4)\\n4\\nThis attention map is multiplied with Vs and the matrix\\nproduct VsAg\\ns is reshaped back to c′ ×h×w by expanding\\nthe spatial dimensions. Finally, using a 1 × 1 convolution,\\nwhich increases channels back to c, we obtain the c×h×w\\nglobal spatial attention feature map Gs.\\nThe right column of Figure 6 shows heat maps for global\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nGlobal attention feature map\\nWe use the global channel\\nattention feature map Fc to weigh F element-wise\\nFg\\nc = F ⊙Gc.\\n(5)\\nWe then use global spatial attention feature map Gs to\\nweigh Fg\\nc element-wise, resulting in the c × h × w global\\nattention feature map\\nFg = Fg\\nc ⊙Gs + Fg\\nc.\\n(6)\\nSimilarly to Fl in (1) and (2), we apply channel attention\\nﬁrst, followed by spatial attention. However, unlike (1),\\nthere is no residual connection in (5). This choice is sup-\\nported by early experiments.\\n3.3. Global-local attention\\nFeature fusion\\nAs shown in Figure 1, we combine the\\nlocal and global attention feature maps, Fl and Fg, with\\nthe original feature F. While concatenation and summation\\nare common operations for feature combination, we use a\\nweighted average with weights wl, wg, w respectively, ob-\\ntained by softmax over three learnable scalar parameters, to\\nobtain a c × h × w global-local attention feature map\\nFgl = wlFl + wgFl + wF.\\n(7)\\nEfﬁcientDet [44] has shown that this is the most effective,\\namong a number of choices, for fusion of features across\\ndifferent scales.\\nPooling\\nWe apply GeM [37], a learnable spatial pooling\\nmechanism, to feature map Fgl (7), followed by a fully-\\nconnected (FC) layer with dropout and batch normalization.\\nThe ﬁnal embedding is obtained by ℓ2-normalization.\\n4. Experiments\\n4.1. Datasets\\nTraining set\\nThere are a number of open landmark\\ndatasets commonly used for training in image retrieval stud-\\nies, including neural code (NC) [3], neural code clean (NC-\\nclean) [16], as well as Google Landmarks v1 (GLDv1) [29]\\nand v2 (GLDv2) [53]. Table 2 shows relevant statistics.\\nThese datasets can be categorized into noisy and clean. The\\nclean sets were obtained from the original noisy sets for\\nmore effective training [16, 53]. The original noisy datasets\\nare much larger, but they have high intra-class variability.\\n(a) input\\n(b) local\\n(c) global\\nFigure 6: Local and global spatial attention. Left: input\\nimages.

The clean datasets\\nfocus on views directly relevant to landmark recognition but\\nhave a much smaller number of images.\\nEvaluation set and metrics\\nWe use four common eval-\\nuation datasets for landmark image retrieval: Oxford5k\\n(Ox5k) [32], Paris6k (Par6k) [33], as well as Revisited Ox-\\nford (ROxford or ROxf) and Paris (RParis or RPar) [35].\\nROxford and RParis are used with and without one million\\ndistractors (R1M) [28] and evaluated using the Medium and\\nHard protocols [35]. We evaluate using mean Average Pre-\\ncision (mAP) and mean precision at 10 (mP@10).\\n4.2. Implementation details\\nWe train on 8 TITAN RTX 2080Ti GPUs. All models are\\npre-trained on ImageNet [39] and implemented in PyTorch\\n[31]. For fair comparisons, we set a training environment\\n5\\nFigure 7: Examples of our ranking results.

The kernel\\nsize k of ECANet in subsection 3.1 is set to 3. The param-\\neter p of GeM in subsection 3.3 is set to 3 and the dimen-\\nsion d of ﬁnal embeddings to 512. We adopt ArcFace [10],\\na cosine-softmax based loss, with a margin of 0.3. We use\\nstochastic gradient descent with initial learning rate 10−3,\\nmomentum 0.9 and weight decay 10−5.\\nWe adopt the batch sampling of Yokoo et al. [56] where\\nmini-batch samples with similar aspect ratios are resized to\\na particular size. Here, we use a batch size of 64. For image\\naugmentation, we apply scaling, random cropping, and var-\\nied illumination. At inference, we apply a multi-resolution\\nrepresentation [16] to query and database images.\\nOur method is denoted as GLAM (global-local atten-\\ntion module). Using the backbone model alone is referred\\nto as baseline. It is compatible with recent models based\\non ResNet101-GeM trained with ArcFace [53, 28]. Adding\\nour local attention (subsection 3.1) to the baseline model is\\ndenoted +local, while adding our global attention (subsec-\\ntion 3.2) is denoted +global. Since we focus on representa-\\ntion learning, we do not consider post-processing methods\\nlike geometry-based re-ranking [29, 40, 53] or graph-based\\nre-ranking [11, 21, 55].\\n4.3.

To achieve best possible performance, we use\\nGLDv2-clean as a training set in the remaining experiments.\\nComparisons on same training set\\nIt is common to com-\\npare methods regardless of training sets as more become\\navailable, e.g., [35, 28]. Since GLDv2-clean is relatively\\nnew, Weyand et al. [53], which introduced the dataset, is the\\nonly study that has trained the same backbone with the same\\nsettings (ResNet101-GeM with ArcFace) on GLDv2-clean.\\nOur baseline is lower than [53], because our dimensinality is\\n512, while other models based on ResNet101 use 2048. Yet,\\nTable 3 shows that our best model trained on GLDv2-clean\\noutperforms [53] by a large margin. But the most impor-\\ntant comparison is with SOLAR [28], also based on self-\\nattention, which has trained ResNet101-GeM on GLDv1-\\nnoisy. On this training set, our best model clearly outper-\\nforms [28] despite lower dimensionality.\\nComparison with state of the art\\nTable 4 shows the\\nperformance of four variants of our model, i.e. baseline\\nwith or without local/global attention, and compares them\\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on global de-\\nscriptors without re-ranking on the complete set of bench-\\nmarks, including distractors. Both local and global atten-\\ntion bring signiﬁcant gain over the baseline. The effect\\nof global is stronger, while the gain of the two is addi-\\ntive in the combination. The best results are achieved by\\nthe global-local attention network (baseline+global+local).\\nWith this model, we outperform previous best methods\\non most benchmarks except mP@10 on RParis (medium)\\nand RParis+R1M (medium), where we are outperformed\\nby [37, 35].

Table 5 shows the results, which are more ﬁne-\\ngrained than those of Table 4. In particular, it shows the ef-\\nfect of the channel and spatial variants of both local and\\nglobal attention. We observe that, when used alone, the\\nchannel and spatial variants of local attention are harmful\\nin most cases. Even the combination, baseline+local, is not\\nalways effective. By contrast, when used alone, the channel\\nand spatial variants of global attention are mostly beneﬁcial,\\nespecially the latter. Their combination, baseline+global, is\\nimpressive, bringing gain of up to 7.5%. Importantly, the\\ncombination baseline+global+local improves further by up\\nto another 2.8%. This result shows the necessity of local\\nattention in the ﬁnal model.\\nCBAM vs. our local spatial attention\\nWe experiment\\nwith the local spatial attention of CBAM [54]. CBAM ap-\\nplies average and max-pooling to input features and con-\\ncatenates the two for spatial attention. We apply this vari-\\nant to our local spatial attention module for comparison.\\nFor the CBAM style module, we keep the overall design\\nof our module as shown in Figure 3, but apply average and\\nmax-pooling to each of the four convolutional layer outputs\\nbefore concatenation. Table 6 shows that the CBAM style\\nmodule is considerably worse than ours on all benchmarks\\nexcept Paris6k, where it is only slightly better.\\nConcatenation vs. sum for feature fusion\\nWe use a\\nsoftmax-based weighted average of local and global atten-\\ntion feature maps with the original feature map (7). Here,\\nwe compare this weighted average with weighted concate-\\nnation, where concatenation replaces the sum operation\\nin (7). As shown in Table 7, the weighted average outper-\\nforms the weighted concatenation.\\nFixed-size vs. group-size sampling\\nNumerous studies\\nhave proposed methods for constructing batches according\\nto image size for efﬁcient training. For instance, Gordo et\\nal. [16], DELF [29], and Yokoo et al. [56] employed dif-\\nferent image sizes per batch for training instead of a single\\nﬁxed size. We adopt the method of Yokoo et al., which con-\\nstructs a batch with images of similar aspect ratio, so that\\nthe images can be resized to a size with an aspect ratio that\\nis similar to their own. We call this method group-size sam-\\npling. Table 8 compares ﬁxed-size (224 × 224) with group-\\nsize sampling. We observe that maintaining aspect ratios by\\nusing dynamic input sizes is much more effective.\\nMulti-resolution\\nWe use the multi-resolution representa-\\ntion [16] for the ﬁnal feature of an image at inference time.\\nThis method: (1) resizes an image into multiple scales; (2)\\nextracts features from the resized images; and (3) averages\\nthe features to obtain the ﬁnal feature of the image. The\\nmethod is applied to both query and database images to en-\\nhance ranking results, especially for small target objects.\\nTable 9 compares the four cases of applying this method or\\nnot to query or database images.\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe have introduced a novel approach that extracts global\\nand local contextual information using attention mecha-\\nnisms for instance-level image retrieval. It is manifested as\\na network architecture consisting of global and local atten-\\ntion components, each operating on both spatial and chan-\\nnel dimensions. This constitutes a comprehensive study and\\nempirical evaluation of all four forms of attention that have\\npreviously been studied only in isolation. Our ﬁndings indi-\\ncate that the gain (or loss) brought by one form of attention\\nalone strongly depends on the presence of the others, with\\nthe maximum gain appearing when all forms are present.\\nThe output is a modiﬁed feature tensor that can be used in\\nany way, for instance with local feature detection instead of\\nspatial pooling for image retrieval.\\nWith the advent of vision transformers [12, 58] and their\\nrecent application to image retrieval [13], attention is ex-\\npected to play a more and more signiﬁcant role in vi-\\nsion. According to our classiﬁcation, transformers perform\\nglobal spatial attention alone. It is of great interest to in-\\nvestigate the role of the other forms of attention, where our\\n8\\napproach may yield a basic building block of such archi-\\ntectures. One may even envision an extension to language\\nmodels, where transformers originate from [50].\\nReferences\\n[1] Relja Arandjelovi´c, Petr Gronat, Akihiko Torii, Tomas Pa-\\njdla, and Josef Sivic.\\nNetVLAD: CNN architecture for\\nweakly supervised place recognition.

Many data driven applications involve processing\\nmassive timeseries data, including IoT [11], medical AI [14], stock\\nmarket [27], and so on. As such, there is a great need for timeseries\\nanalytics, such as forecasting [8], classification [20], clustering [31],\\nsimilarity search [39], and anomaly detection [50], with applications\\nranging from automatically diagnosing diseases [5], recognizing\\nhuman activities [29], to stopping financial fraud [59].\\nEffective feature extraction [40] lies at the core of almost all\\nthese timeseries analytics tasks. Recently researchers [61] have\\nstarted leveraging the self-supervised pre-training methodology of\\nTransformers [4, 16, 52], which have proven remarkably successful\\nin natural language processing (NLP), to automatically learn high\\nquality feature embeddings from timeseries. In NLP, self-supervised\\npre-training exploits the sequential patterns (correlations) among\\nthe words in sentences to produce contextualized feature embed-\\ndings. Timeseries bear similarity to natural language, because in\\ntimeseries data the sequential order among the values (stock price,\\nvolume, etc.) over time matters. That is, each value is highly cor-\\nrelated with other values observed before or after it. Therefore,\\n∗Corresponding Author\\npre-training a Transformer model which takes the correlations\\namong different observations into account is a natural idea to learn\\nfeature embeddings from timeseries. Indeed, the experiments in [61]\\nconfirm that Transformer-based methods outperform traditional\\ntimeseries analytics techniques.\\nHowever, existing work [61] that directly applies Transformers\\nto learn features from timeseries data have been shown not to be\\nscalable to long timeseries [30]. The idea of self-attention [52] is\\ncentral to pre-training methods in NLP: It computes pairwise cor-\\nrelations among different semantic units in a sequence (in NLP, a\\nsentence); as such, it has quadratic time and space complexity in\\nthe length of the input sequence. Such an approach places limits on\\nthe model’s scalability, especially when handling large sequences,\\nwhich are common in real-world timeseries applications such as\\nIoT, medical AI, and finance [6, 34, 62]. Predictions about timeseries\\nmay need to look at months or years of historical data to make ac-\\ncurate predictions, spanning hundreds of thousands of samples. As\\nan example, in collaboration with a research hospital we have been\\ndeveloping a seizure classifier that automatically detects seizures\\nbased on EEG signals (timeseries) collected during the clinical ob-\\nservation of patients. As seizures last only a few seconds, we chunk\\nlong EEG data into many 2 second segments and detect seizures at\\na segment level. However, the classification of a particular segment\\ndepends on up to 12 hours of prior signal to determine if one 2\\nsecond segment indicates seizure or not, because seizure diagnosis\\nneeds to consider long-term trends in the EEG data [6]. The number\\nof segments in 12 hours is more than 21k. This is far larger than\\nthe number of semantic units the typical NLP tasks expect. For\\nexample, BERT [16] limits the number of units to 512 and even\\nmassive models like GPT-3 [4] limit the number of units to 2048.\\nAlthough in NLP some lower-complexity methods have been\\nproposed to approximately compute self-attention [10, 26, 54], their\\nperformance degrades dramatically when used on timeseries, due\\nto the gap between natural language and timeseries, as we will\\nshow in our experiments.\\nProposed Approach. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we\\ndevelop RITA, a Transformer-based timeseries analytics tool, which\\nuses a novel attention mechanism, called group attention, to scale\\nto long timeseries.\\nLeveraging the periodicity of timeseries, RITA chunks the input\\ntimeseries into segments and dynamically clusters the segments\\ninto a small number (denoted as 𝑁) of groups. Segments in the\\nsame group possess similar feature embeddings during the current\\ntraining iteration, thus enabling them to approximately share the\\n1\\narXiv:2306.01926v1  [cs.LG]  2 Jun 2023\\ncomputation of attention. As the timeseries increases in length,\\nmore sharing opportunities become available. RITA then computes\\nthe self-attention at a group level and produces a compressed group\\nattention matrix. In this way, group attention eliminates both com-\\nputation and memory bottlenecks in Transformer-style models and\\nthus more scalable to long timeseries.\\nHowever, making this idea effective and efficient in Transformer\\narchitectures is challenging for several reasons:\\n• Efficiently Producing High Quality Feature Embeddings.\\nAlthough RITA computes the attention matrix at a group level, to\\npreserve the quality of the feature embeddings, it still has to pro-\\nduce different embeddings for different segments. This is because\\neven if some segments share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding. However,\\nusing the group attention matrix, the existing self-attention mech-\\nanism will only produce a single feature vector for each group. A\\nnaive solution would be to restore the original attention matrix\\nfrom the group attention matrix. However, in this case we again\\nget an attention matrix with quadratic space complexity. Because\\nGPUs have limited memory, GPU memory will remain a bottleneck\\nin group attention.\\n• The Number of Groups N. In RITA, the number of groups\\n𝑁is a crucial factor that balances the speed up and the quality of\\nattention approximation. A small 𝑁will lead to a large speedup,\\nbut the approximation errors can also be significant. On the other\\nhand, although a large 𝑁tends to produce high-quality approxima-\\ntions, it inevitably slows down the training process. Therefore, an\\nappropriate 𝑁is essential to the performance of group attention.\\nHowever, 𝑁depends on the distributional properties of the dataset.\\nFurthermore, like the classical transformer models, RITA stacks\\nmultiple attention layers to produce better embeddings. Ideally,\\ndifferent layers should also use different values of 𝑁. In addition,\\nduring the model training phrase, group attention should use dif-\\nferent values of 𝑁at different iterations to adapt to the varying\\nfeature embeddings. This makes manually setting appropriate 𝑁\\nalmost impossible.\\n• Batch Size. Moreover, as we want to dynamically adjust 𝑁\\nduring training, a fixed batch size is sub-optimal: as 𝑁decreases,\\nthe memory usage of a single sample decreases. This allows a larger\\nbatch size which is beneficial, because: (1) it makes full use of GPU\\nmemory; (2) high-parallelism across the samples in a big batch\\nbrings better performance. Our experimental study shows that\\ndoubling the batch size reduces the training time by 30%, while still\\npreserving the quality of the model. Thus, RITA should dynamically\\nadjust batch size as 𝑁changes.\\nTo address the above problems, we first propose an embedding\\naggregation strategy and a customized group softmax function to\\nreplace the classical softmax function [52]. Together they ensure\\nRITA is able to directly use the compressed attention matrix to\\nproduce different feature embeddings for different segments. We\\ntheoretically show the embeddings RITA produces in this way are\\nidentical to those produced by first re-storing the original large\\nattention matrix. Thus RITA is able to produce high quality embed-\\ndings without introducing extra overhead. Further, we design a GPU\\nfriendly algorithm to group the segments in parallel, effectively\\nminimizing the grouping cost.\\nP0\\nPosition\\nEmbedding\\nW1\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nWindow \\nEmbedding\\n+\\nE0\\nRaw\\nTimeseries\\nTime-aware \\nConvolution\\nW[CLS]\\nW2\\n⊗\\n.....\\nWn\\nP1\\nP2\\n.....\\nPn\\n.....\\nE1\\nE2\\nEn\\n.....\\nO0\\nO1\\nO2\\nOn\\n.....\\nRITA Encoder\\nScale & Input\\nFigure 1: RITA Architecture\\nSecond, we design an adaptive scheduler which dynamically de-\\ncides an appropriate 𝑁for each group attention layer during the\\ntraining process. It starts with a large 𝑁and iteratively merges\\ngroups that are similar to each other. Guided by an error bound on\\nthe approximated self-attention that users can tolerate, it automati-\\ncally determines if two groups are mergeable, performing merging\\nefficiently in a GPU-friendly way.\\nMoreover, we propose a learning-based method to model the\\ncorrelation between the number of groups 𝑁and the batch size 𝐵.\\nThis model is used to predict 𝐵for a given 𝑁when training RITA.\\nSpecifically, we first sample some 𝑁values in a reasonable range.\\nFor each sampled 𝑁, we find a batch size that consumes up to a\\ncertain percentage of GPU memory in a cost-efficient way. Using a\\nsmall set of mathematical functions as a prior, RITA learns a model\\nwith only a few <N, B> pairs as ground truth labels.\\nOur experiments on public timeseries benchmarks and the MGH\\nEEG data [6] confirm that RITA outperforms state-of-the-art meth-\\nods in accuracy on various timeseries analytics tasks, while our\\ngroup attention mechanism achieves a 63X speedup with much\\nless memory required, compared to existing self-attention mecha-\\nnisms [10, 52, 54].\\nContributions. The key contributions of this work include:\\n• Our group attention mechanism leverages the periodicity of\\ntimeseries, reducing the time and space complexity of the self-\\nattention mechanism with accuracy guarantees, allowing RITA to\\nscale to long timeseries data.\\n• Guided by an approximation error bound, our adaptive sched-\\nuler dynamically adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nto the distribution properties of the evolving feature embeddings,\\nmaking group attention efficient and easily tunable.\\n• We conduct experiments on various datasets and different ana-\\nlytics tasks, demonstrating that RITA is 4 to 63 times faster than\\nthe state-of-the-art while achieving better accuracy when handling\\nlong timeseries (length ≥2000).\\n2\\n2\\nBACKGROUND\\nWe provide some background on the canonical self-attention mod-\\nule in the Transformer[52]. A self-attention module takes 𝑛hidden\\nembedding vectors 𝐻∈R𝑛∗𝑑ℎas input, then projects them to\\nqueries (𝑄), keys (𝐾) and values (𝑉) and performs Scaled-dot Prod-\\nuct Attention, which given input hidden state 𝐻, is computed by:\\n𝑄= 𝐻𝑊𝑄, 𝐾= 𝐻𝑊𝐾,𝑉= 𝐻𝑊𝑉\\n𝑂= 𝐴𝑉= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥( 𝑄𝐾𝑇\\n√︁\\n𝑑𝑘\\n)𝑉\\n(1)\\nWhere 𝑊𝑄∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝐾∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑉∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑣are projection\\nmatrices for generating 𝑄, 𝐾,𝑉. 𝑄∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘is also regarded as the\\npacking of 𝑛query vectors {𝑞1, ...,𝑞𝑛} with dimension 𝑑𝑘into a\\nmatrix. 𝐾∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘,𝑉∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑣are regarded as the packing of key\\nvectors {𝑘1, ...,𝑘𝑛} and value vectors {𝑣1, ..., 𝑣𝑛} in the same way.\\nGiven a matrix 𝑀∈R𝐿∗𝑛, the softmax function normalizes 𝑀\\nto ensure the sum of each row equals to 1, as shown below.\\n𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑀𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑛−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑘)\\n(2)\\nNote the attention matrix A is an 𝑛×𝑛matrix, where 𝑛represents\\nthe number of elements in the input sequence (e.g. words in NLP).\\n3\\nRITA OVERVIEW\\nGiven a collection of unlabeled timeseries, RITA first pre-trains\\na Transformer-style model to produce high quality feature em-\\nbeddings for timeseries data. This pre-trained model is then used\\nto support various downstream tasks, similar to BERT [16]. Next,\\nwe overview the model architecture of RITA. We show how RITA\\nsupports various downstream tasks in Appendix A.7.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, RITA is consist of two components: (1) Time-\\naware Convolution Layer (2) RITA Encoder.\\nTime-aware Convolution Layer fills the gap between timeseries\\nand natural language. Despite their high-level similarity, there is a\\nbig gap between timeseries and natural language. First, in natural\\nlanguage each word, as a discrete semantic unit, has an indepen-\\ndent meaning, while each element in a timeseries is a continuous,\\nnumerical value and does not necessarily constitute an independent\\nevent. Furthermore, the input sequences are single-channeled in\\nNLP, but often multi-channeled in timeseries (i.e., sensor data often\\nconsists of several related channels).\\nRITA leverages the classical convolution [28] strategy to solve\\nthis problem. Convolution is widely used to capture the local struc-\\ntures of an image. We use convolution to chunk one input timeseries\\ninto a sequence of windows and learn the local structure of each\\nwindow, similar to the discrete semantic units in natural language.\\nIt also discovers the correlations across different channels, thus\\nnaturally solving the multi-channel problem.\\nMore specifically, treating a multi-variate timeseries of length 𝑛\\nand with𝑚variables as an n × m matrix𝑇, RITA uses𝑑convolution\\nkernels to chunk𝑇into n windows and produce one d-dimensional\\nembedding per window using the convolution operation [28]. Each\\nconvolution kernel corresponds to a w × m matrix, where 𝑤defines\\nthe number of timestamps that each convolution kernel covers,\\nidentical to the window size in sliding window.\\nRITA Encoder functions as Transformer Encoder as described in\\nthe original Transformer work[52]. It takes the embeddings of 𝑛\\nsemantic units 𝑋1,𝑋2, ...,𝑋𝑛(𝑋𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as input (e.g. embeddings of\\n𝑛windows for a timeseries), then models the correlations between\\nthe semantic units and outputs 𝑌1, ...,𝑌𝑛(𝑌𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as the context-\\naware embedding of each unit.\\nWhat makes RITA Encoder different from Transformer Encoder\\nis that: at the core of Transformer Encoder lies self-attention mech-\\nanism which incurs a 𝑂(𝑛2) time complexity and memory usage.\\nThis quadratic cost becomes prohibitive for long timeseries and\\nlimits the scalablity of Transformer-based models. To make the\\nattention computation efficient yet high-quality, we replace the\\ncanonical self-attention with our proposed group attention.\\nSelf-supervised Pretraining. Inspired by the “cloze text” pre-\\ntraining task in NLP, we designed a mask-and-predict task as the\\npretraining task for our model. The timeseries is randomly masked\\nand the model should recover the masked values based on corre-\\nsponding contextual information.\\nTo be specific, we generate masks on time-stamps, with a mask\\nrate 𝑝. The timeseries is scaled to be non-negative and the values\\nacross all the channels on the masked timestamps are set to be -1,\\nan impossible value on normal timestamps. Then the masked time-\\nseries is fed into RITA and the output representation is translated\\nto the recovered timeseries by a Transpose Convolution layer.\\n4\\nGROUP ATTENTION MECHANISM\\nGroup attention, a novel and efficient approximate attention mecha-\\nnism, addresses the performance bottleneck of self-attention in the\\nvanilla Transformer. In this section, we first introduce the frame-\\nwork of group attention and then theoretically establish the bound\\nof its approximation error.\\n4.1\\nThe Idea of Group Attention\\nAs periodicity is a natural property of timeseries [56], similar\\nwindows frequently occur. Similar windows result in similar\\nqueries/keys for attention computation, bringing opportunities for\\nsaving computation.\\nAs discussed in Sec. 2, 𝐴𝑖𝑗, the attention score of window 𝑖onto\\nwindow 𝑗, is determined by the inner product between the query\\nvector of window 𝑖and the key vector of window 𝑗, that is, 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗.\\nGiven another window 𝑥, if window 𝑥has the similar key vector\\nto window 𝑗, that is, 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥, then 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗≈𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑥. In other words,\\n𝐴𝑖𝑗≈𝐴𝑖𝑥when 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥.\\nThis observation inspires our group attention mechanism. That\\nis, we group the windows by their similarity in keys. Assuming\\nall windows in the same group have the same attention score onto\\nanother window 𝑘, we then only compute the attention once by\\nusing one single key to represent this group, for example the centroid\\nof the group of keys. This thus saves significant computation cost.\\nBetter yet, after grouping 𝑛windows into 𝑁groups, group atten-\\ntion compresses the attention matrix from an𝑛×𝑛matrix to an𝑛×𝑁\\nmatrix. Because 𝑁(number of groups) tends to be much smaller\\nthan 𝑛(number of windows) due to the periodicity of timeseries,\\ngroup attention consumes much less memory than the original\\nself-attention mechanism, successfully eliminating the memory\\nbottleneck. Note that it also doesn’t hurt quality all that much, as\\nconfirmed in our experiments (Sec. 6.2).\\n3\\nGrouping\\nAverage\\nK\\nQ\\nMatMul\\nAttention Matrix\\nWeighted\\nSoftMax\\nV\\nSum\\nAggregate\\nTranspose\\nMatMul\\nOutput\\nQ \\nK \\nV\\nFigure 2: Group Attention\\n4.2\\nComputing the Output Feature Embedding\\nWe now discuss how to efficiently compute the output feature\\nembeddings using the small compressed group attention matrix.\\n4.2.1\\nProblem: Producing Embeddings w/ Group Attention Matrix\\nAs described in the Background, once we have acquired the at-\\ntention matrix 𝐴, canonical self-attention computes the output\\nembedding 𝑂as O = AV. Because 𝐴is an 𝑛× 𝑛matrix and 𝑉is an\\n𝑛×𝑑𝑣matrix, the matrix product operation still produces an 𝑛×𝑑𝑣\\nmatrix 𝑂. That is, it produces a 𝑑𝑣dimensional feature vector for\\neach window. However, our group attention will produce an 𝑛× 𝑁\\nattention matrix e\\n𝐴, where 𝑁corresponds to the number of groups.\\nIn this case the matrix product will produce a 𝑁×𝑑𝑣matrix e\\n𝑂. That\\nis, it produces a feature vector for each group. However, our goal\\nis to produce different embeddings for different windows, because\\neven if some windows share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding.\\nA Naive Solution. A naive solution would be to restore the full\\nattention matrix 𝐴from the group attention matrix e\\n𝐴. For example,\\ngiven one group composed of 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗, we map its group\\nattention vector in e\\n𝐴into two rows that correspond to 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗in 𝐴. However, in this case we again get a 𝑛× 𝑛attention\\nmatrix; and GPU memory remains a bottleneck in group attention.\\n4.2.2\\nSolution: Embedding Aggregation and Group SoftMax\\nUsing an embedding aggregation operation and a group softmax\\nfunction, RITA produces 𝑛embeddings without restoring the full\\nattention matrix. Fig. 2 shows the workflow of group attention.\\nEmbedding Aggregation. The idea is inspired by the observation\\non the matrix product operation O = AV conducted on the fully\\nrestored attention matrix 𝐴.\\nGiven an element𝑂𝑖,𝑗of𝑂corresponding to the 𝑗𝑡ℎdimension of\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖’s feature vector,𝑂𝑖,𝑗= 𝑎𝑖·𝑣𝑗, where vector ai ∈Rn denotes the\\n𝑖𝑡ℎrow of the attention matrix 𝐴and vector vj ∈Rn denotes the 𝑗𝑡ℎ\\ndimension of all the 𝑛feature vectors. Given ai =< a1\\ni , a2\\ni , · · · , an\\ni >\\nand vj =< v1\\nj , v2\\nj , · · · , vn\\nj >, 𝑂𝑖,𝑗= Ín\\nk=1 ak\\ni vk\\nj .\\nAs an example, assume 𝑤𝑖𝑛1 and 𝑤𝑖𝑛2 belong to the same group\\n𝐺1. Then 𝑎1\\n𝑖= 𝑎2\\n𝑖= e𝑎1\\n𝑖, where e𝑎1\\n𝑖∈e\\n𝐴corresponds to the attention\\nof group 𝐺1 onto 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖. Therefore, 𝑎1\\n𝑖𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑎2\\n𝑖𝑣2\\n𝑗= e𝑎1\\n𝑖(𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑣2\\n𝑗).\\nAs an immediate generalization of the above analysis, if we ag-\\ngregate up the windows that belong to the same group and convert\\nthe n-dimensional feature vector 𝑣𝑗into a 𝑁-dimensional group fea-\\nture vectore𝑣𝑗beforehand, we could directly use the group attention\\nvector e𝑎𝑖and the group feature vector e𝑣𝑗to compute 𝑂𝑖,𝑗.\\nUsing embedding aggregation, RITA is able to produce the fea-\\nture embedding e\\n𝑂that is identical to the embedding 𝑂produced\\nby using the full attention matrix 𝐴and the embedding matrix 𝑉.\\nGroup Softmax Function. In canonical self-attention the atten-\\ntion matrix 𝐴is computed as 𝐴= SoftMax( QKT\\n√\\ndk ). To compute 𝐴,\\nwe have to first compute 𝑄𝐾𝑇(denoted as 𝑃) which is an 𝑛× 𝑛\\nmatrix. Then normalizing the 𝑃matrix with softmax produces the\\nattention matrix 𝐴.\\nGroup attention follows the same procedure. But after grouping\\nkeys into e𝐾, 𝑄e𝐾𝑇produces an 𝑛× 𝑁matrix e𝑃. Due to the non-\\nlinearity of the softmax function, applying softmax directly on e𝑃\\nwill result in a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴from which we are not able\\nto recover a full attention matrix that is identical to first restoring\\ne𝑃to 𝑃and then applying softmax on 𝑃. The 𝐴matrix produced\\nby the latter is desirable, as we want to approximate the original\\nattention matrix as accurately as possible. However, restoring the\\nsmall 𝑛× 𝑁e𝑃matrix is not memory efficient, as it will end up with\\na full 𝑛× 𝑛matrix 𝑃.\\nTo solve the above problems, we introduce a new group softmax\\nfunction to replace the original softmax function (Eq. 2).\\n𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(g\\n𝑃𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑘)\\n(3)\\nIn Eq. 3, 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘represents the number of windows that Group\\n𝐺𝑘contains. Compared to the original softmax, our group softmax\\nconsiders each group 𝐺𝑘as 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘elements and counts it 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘\\ntimes when summing up the exponential of each group’s 𝑃𝑖,𝑘. In\\nthis way, the group softmax function operating on the small e𝑃\\nmatrix will produce exactly the same result to the softmax function\\noperating on the full 𝑃matrix.\\nTheoretical Guarantee. In Appendix A.4, we prove that the group\\nsoftmax function and the embedding aggregation operation produce\\nthe same output feature embedding with the naive method that has\\nto first restore the big full attention matrix.\\nWe show an efficient implementation of the embedding aggrega-\\ntion operation and group softmax function in Appendix A.2, Alg. 1.\\nTime Complexity. The time complexity of Alg. 1 is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁𝑑) and\\nthe space complexity is𝑂(𝑛𝑁), while the time and space complexity\\nof the original self-attention mechanism are 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑) and 𝑂(𝑛2).\\n4.3\\nError Bound\\nGroup attention produces a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴which approxi-\\nmates the attention matrix𝐴produced by the classical self-attention\\nwith a bounded error, as shown in Lemma 1.\\nLemma 1. Let 𝑅be the radius of the ball where all key vectors\\nlive; e𝑘𝑖be the representative of the group that contains key 𝑘𝑖. Let 𝐴\\ndenote the full attention matrix restored from e\\n𝐴. Suppose the distance\\nbetween e𝑘𝑖and 𝑘𝑖(||ek𝑖−k𝑖||) satisfies: ||ek𝑖−k𝑖|| ≤d.\\nThen ∀𝜖> 1, if d ≤ln(𝜖)\\n2R , 1\\n𝜖≤Ai,j\\nAi,j ≤𝜖\\nLemma 1 shows that the error bound 𝜖of the group attention is\\ndetermined by the distance 𝑑. As discussed in Sec. 5.1, it inspires\\nus to design a strategy to dynamically determine the number of\\ngroups 𝑁– the most critical parameter of group attention. Please\\nrefer to Appendix A.5 for the proof.\\n4\\n4.4\\nGPU Friendly Grouping Method\\nIn this section, we discuss the implementation of a grouping method.\\nTo make group attention efficient and effective, the grouping\\nmethod has to satisfy the following requirements:\\n(1) Tight distance bound: to ensure the approximation quality,\\nthe distance between each key and its group representative should\\nbe minimized according to Lemma 1.\\n(2) Lightweight: to ensure the performance gain, the grouping\\nmethod must be lightweight, at worst not exceeding the complexity\\nof group attention itself (𝑂(𝑁𝑛)).\\n(3) GPU friendly: to take advantage of GPUs, we prefer a group-\\ning method that mainly consists of matrix operations, which can\\nbe efficiently executed on a GPU.\\nTo satisfy the above requirements, after thorough investigation\\non various clustering algorithms, we design a GPU friendly K-\\nmeans [35] as the grouping method.\\nFirst, K-means minimizes the overall distance between any object\\nand its cluster center, hence naturally satisfying Requirement 1.\\nSecond, given 𝑁centers, in each iteration the time and space\\ncomplexity of K-means is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁). Usually, the iteration goes until\\nconvergence. However, we observe that rather than seeking a per-\\nfect K-means clustering, training a few iterations is sufficient to\\nget a good grouping for group attention, because typically the later\\niterations only slightly update the clustering and group attention\\nis robust to such imperfection.\\nThird, we design a GPU-friendly implementation of K-means.\\nThe performance bottleneck of K-means comes from the dis-\\ntance computation between each vector and its center, that is,\\n|vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n(vi −cj)2, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. The performance bot-\\ntleneck is 𝑣𝑖−𝑐𝑗. We instead use a different formulation: |𝑣𝑖−\\n𝑐𝑗| = |vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n|vi|2 + |cj|2 −2vi · cj, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. This is\\nbecause in this formulation, the performance bottleneck is 𝑣𝑖· 𝑐𝑗,\\nwhich could be implemented as a matrix product operation. Al-\\nthough the complexity of the two formulations is the same, in GPUs\\nmatrix product is much more efficient than pairwise difference.\\n5\\nADAPTIVE SCHEDULER\\nNext, we present the adaptive scheduler of RITA which addresses\\nthe challenges of determining an appropriate number of groups\\n𝑁and accordingly the batch size 𝐵, as described in Introduction.\\nUsing a dynamic scheduling method we propose, the scheduler\\nautomatically determines and adjusts 𝑁and 𝐵based on the distri-\\nbutional properties of the feature embeddings produced over the\\niterative training process, while guaranteed to produce high quality\\nattention approximation that meets the requirement of users.\\nIn Sec. 5.1 we show how RITA automatically determines 𝑁. Then\\nwe introduce in Sec. 5.2 the learning-based method which given an\\n𝑁, immediately predicts a good batch size.\\n5.1\\nDynamically Determining the Number of\\nGroups N\\nWithout loss of generality, we use one group attention module as\\nan example to show how RITA automatically gets an appropriate 𝑁.\\nThe adaptive scheduler of RITA starts with a large 𝑁and decreases\\nit dynamically. This is because in the training process of RITA, the\\nfeature embeddings produced epoch by epoch tend to get stabler\\nand stabler and gradually converge, thus no need to increase 𝑁.\\nRITA reduces the number of groups by merging similar groups.\\nIntuitively, given two groups, we could measure their similarity\\nbased on the distance of their centers. If the distance between\\ntheir centers is smaller than a distance threshold, then the two\\ngroups could be merged. However, setting an appropriate distance\\nthreshold seems hard – as difficult as setting an appropriate 𝑁.\\nTo solve this problem, RITA leverages the error bound of group\\nattention introduced in Sec. 4.3. It only requires users to set an\\nerror bound 𝜖, and then uses Lemma 1 to translate 𝜖to a distance\\nthreshold 𝑑. RITA then uses Lemma 2 to determine if merging some\\ngiven clusters still meets the error bound threshold 𝜖.\\nLemma 2. Denote 𝑐𝑘to be the cluster center of 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘. Assume\\nthe existing grouping satisfies ∀k,\\nmax\\nx∈clusterk\\n|ck −x| ≤d , thus satis-\\nfying an error bound 𝜖by Lemma 1. If there exist 𝑚clusters, namely,\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘2, ...,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑚, satisfying that:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑐𝑘𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑘𝑖| ≤𝑑,𝑖, 𝑗∈[1,𝑚]\\n(4)\\nmerging them into one cluster still meets the error bound 𝜖.\\nPlease refer to Appendix A.6 for the proof.\\nFinding the Mergable Clusters. We formulate the problem of\\nfinding mergeable clusters using graph theory:\\n(1) each cluster is a node in the graph;\\n(2) if 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑, and\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\nthere is an undirected edge between 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑖and 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗;\\nIn this scenario, finding the maximum number of mergeable\\nclusters is equivalent to finding the minimal clique cover in the\\ncorresponding graph, which is an NP-hard problem [24]. Such\\nheavy computation overhead is not acceptable for RITA. We thus\\noffer a simplified solution:\\n(1) Halve the clusters into two sets 𝑆1,𝑆2;\\n(2) If 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1 and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗∈𝑆2 satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\n2\\n(5)\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗is marked.\\n(3) Decrease the number of clusters by counting the masks in 𝑆2.\\nIn this solution, clusters in 𝑆1 can be regarded as transfer nodes.\\nIf (5) holds for (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1 ∈𝑆2) and (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈\\n𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗2 ∈𝑆2), respectively, we have,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗2 | ≤𝑑\\n(6)\\nThus (4) holds when merging several clusters in 𝑆2 with one\\ncluster in 𝑆1. As a result, we can greedily merge clusters in 𝑆2, as\\nillustrated in step(3).\\nAssume the number of clusters decreases by 𝐷after merging,\\nwe apply a momentum update [42] on the number of clusters 𝑁, as\\nis commonly used in machine learning to smooth the changing of\\n𝑁and avoid sample selection bias. To be specific: 𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑤= 𝛼(𝑁−\\n𝐷) + (1 −𝛼)𝑁, where 𝛼is a hyper-parameter for momentum.\\n5\\n5.2\\nDynamically Determining the Batch Size\\nBecause of the dynamic grouping operation, the computational\\ngraph in deep learning training [1] varies from sample to sample. As\\na result, it is impossible to precisely compute a batch’s GPU memory\\nusage without indeed feeding it into the model. To overcome this\\nproblem, RITA learns a batch size prediction function offline; then\\nat the RITA training time, given a number of groups 𝑁, RITA uses\\nthis function to predict a proper batch size.\\nWhen the model architecture and hardware are fixed, the batch\\nsize depends on the length of the timeseries 𝐿and the average\\ngroup number among all attention module 𝑁. So RITA samples\\nseveral (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs and estimate a proper batch size for each pair.\\nMore specifically, given a user-defined timeseries maximal length\\n𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, we randomly sample integral points (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) from plane\\n{1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}. Then we use a binary search based\\nalgorithm to find the maximal batch size 𝐵𝑖that consumes less than\\n90% available GPU memory, aiming to avoid wasting GPU memory\\nand the risks of out of memory (OOM).\\nTreating these pairs as ground truth labels, we use function\\nfitting [18] to learn the batch size predicting function B = f (L, N),\\nwhere B is a function of two variables 𝐿and 𝑁.\\nLearning the Prediction Function. We apply curve fit from\\nSciPy [53] as the function fitting tool to fit the two-variable function\\n𝐵𝑖= 𝑓(𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) on plane {1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}.\\nWe observe that applying one function to the whole plane incurs\\na huge estimation error. So we develop a dynamic-programming\\n(DP) method to divide the plane into several sub-planes and apply\\na distinct function to each sub-plane respectively. It is optimal in\\nminimizing the total estimation error on all sub-planes\\nWith the learned prediction function 𝑓, we can estimate a proper\\nbatch size for any (𝐿, 𝑁) during training, even if it is not seen in\\nthe sampled (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs.\\nThe Algorithms and Optimality Proof. Please refer to Appen-\\ndix A.3 for the pseudo code of the binary search-based algorithm\\nand the description of the DP method for plane-division and the\\nproof for its optimality.\\n6\\nEVALUATION\\nOur experimental study focuses on the following questions:\\n1. Effectiveness and efficiency of RITA: How does RITA com-\\npare with other Transformer-based methods and traditional time-\\nseries representation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency?\\n2. Ablation Study: How do the key techniques of RITA work?\\n6.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nDatasets. We evaluate RITA on classification and imputation tasks\\nusing 5 multi-variate and 3 uni-variate timeseries datasets.\\n• WISDM [55] is a popular multivariate timeseries dataset gen-\\nerated from the accelerometer in the mobile phone. The subjects\\nperformed 18 daily activities (e.g. walking, jogging). The dataset\\nwas collected from 51 subjects and the sampling rate is 20 Hz.\\n• HHAR dataset [46] contains sensing data of accelerometer col-\\nlected from 9 users performing 5 activities with 12 different smart-\\nphones (varying in sampling rate). This increases the complexity\\nof the task and thus can test the model’s robustness.\\n• RWHAR RealWorld HAR dataset [48] covers 15 subjects per-\\nforming 8 locomotion-style activities. Each subject wears the sen-\\nsors for approximately ten minutes. The sampling rate is 50 Hz.\\n• ECG dataset [34] consists of 10,000 EEG recordings for arrhyth-\\nmia classification. Each recording has an uncertain length ranging\\nfrom 6 to 60 seconds sampled at 500 Hz. The ECG recordings corre-\\nspond to 9 types of heart problems such as atrial fibrillation (AF)\\nand premature atrial contraction (PAC), etc.\\n• MGH [6] is a EEG dataset collected by Mass. General Hospital.\\nEach timeseries corresponds to the EEG data observed from one\\npatient during their stay in ICU for a couple of days. The EEG\\nmonitoring produced data with 20 channels. The sampling rate is\\n200 HZ. So it produces very long timeseries.\\n• WISDM*/HHAR*/RWHAR* are three uni-variate datasets de-\\nrived by picking one channel from WISDM/HHAR/RWHAR.\\nTraining/Validation Data Generation. We apply a sliding win-\\ndow on the raw timeseries to get training/validation samples. The\\nsize of the sliding window is set as 200 on small datasets (WISDM,\\nHHAR, RWHAR), 2000 on medium size dataset (ECG), and 10,000\\non the large dataset (MGH). Table 1 shows the statics of the gen-\\nerated datasets. They are randomly split into training/validation\\nset in a proportion of 0.9/0.1. In “pretraining + few-label finetun-\\ning” scenario, we use 100 labeled data per class for finetuning. We\\nguarantee that training set does not overlap with the validation set.\\nDataset\\nTrain.

We compare RITA against the SOTA Trans-\\nformer based timeseries representation learning method TST [61].\\nTo evaluate our group attention (referred to as Group Attn.), we\\ndevelop three baselines by replacing the group attention compo-\\nnent in RITA with the classic vanilla Self-Attention [52](referred\\nto as Vanilla) and two SOTA methods that reduce the complexity\\nof self-attention by approximation in NLP, namely, Performer [10]\\n(referred to as Performer) and Linformer [54] (referred to as Lin-\\nformer). Similar to our proposed Group Attn., Vanilla, Performer,\\nLinformer all use RITA’s time-aware convolution operation (Sec. 3)\\nto turn timeseries segments into input feature vectors.\\nWe also compare Group Attn. against GRAIL [40], which is\\nthe SOTA of the non-deep learning methods for timeseries repre-\\nsentation learning. GRAIL supports classification tasks by feeding\\nthe learned representations into a Support-Vector Machine [12]\\nor K-Nearest Neighbor [17] classifier. Note GRAIL only targets\\nuni-variate timeseries and cannot support imputation tasks.\\nMethodology. We mainly focus on two downstream tasks:\\n(1) Classification. First, we train Group Attn. and the base-\\nlines with full labels from scratch to test the effectiveness of RITA\\nframework and the approximation quality of our group attention.\\nSecond, to measure the effectiveness of self-supervised pretrain-\\ning, we evaluate the accuracy of training on few labeled timeseries\\nwith/without pretraining on large scales of unlabeled timeseries. To\\nbe specific, we split the training set into a pretraining set and a fine-\\ntuning set, with very few data in the latter (100 labeled samples per\\n6\\n(a) Effectiveness \\n(b) Efficiency\\nTraining Time/sec\\nFigure 3: Full-label classification results (multi-variate data).\\nclass in our experiment). We train the model on the cloze pretrain-\\ning task with a mask rate 𝑝= 0.2. Then we train two classification\\nmodels using the finetuning set, either based on the pretrained\\nversion or from scratch. We repeat the experiment 5 times with\\nrandom data splits and report the median accuracy.\\n(2) Imputation. We run the imputation task on the datasets used\\nin classification as well as the large unlabeled MGH dataset, and\\nmeasure the mean square error and absolute imputation error. To\\nget timeseries with missing values, we randomly mask the values\\nwith an expected mask rate of 𝑝= 0.2. The masked values are\\nreplaced with a special value.\\nFinally, to evaluate Group Attn.’s benefit on efficiency, the total\\ntime of forward computation, backward propagation, and grouping\\nare measured for all methods in all the experiments.\\nTo save space, we only report the average training time per epoch\\nhere and refer readers to Appendix A.8 for the inference time.\\nWe first compare against the Transformer-based methods on\\nmulti-variate datasets (sec. 6.2, 6.3), then compare against the non-\\ndeep learning method GRAIL on uni-variate datasets (sec. 6.4).\\nConfiguration. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for the experiment\\nconfiguration and hyper-parameter settings.\\n6.2\\nEffectiveness: Transformer-Based Methods\\nWe first evaluate the quality of the models trained with full labels\\nfrom scratch. We then show how the pretraining of RITA increases\\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks.\\n6.2.1\\nfull-label training (Multi-variate classification)\\nResults shown in Figure 3(a) get us the following observations:\\n(1) RITA’s advantage over TST. On all four datasets for the clas-\\nsification tasks, Group Attn. and the other three baselines that use\\nRITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and Linformer) outperform\\nTST. In particular, Group Attn. outperforms TST by 49 percentage\\npoints on the ECG dataset (88.48% vs 39.93%) with long timeseries.\\nTwo deficiencies in TST may cause its poor performance on the long\\ntimeseries. Firstly, TST concatenates the output embedding vector\\nof each time stamp, then uses a linear classifier to do classification\\non the concatenated vector. When the timeseries is long, the linear\\nclassifier has so many parameters that it tends to overfit easily.\\nSecondly, TST replaces Layer Normalization in vanilla Transformer\\nwith Batch Normalization. When the timeseries is long, it can only\\naccommodate a small number of timeseries in each batch, leading\\nto bias in Batch Normalization.\\n(2) Group-attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on\\n3 out of 4 datasets for classification. Although Linformer works\\nslightly better than Group Attn. on the ECG dataset (90.37% vs\\n88.84%), its performance is the worst in all other cases compared\\nto any other RITA-based methods. Vanilla computes the attention\\nscores precisely. Thus it is expected to work well. However, Group\\nAttn. outperforms Vanilla on WISDM (87.50% vs 86.95%) and is very\\nclose to it on other 3 datasets. This suggests that group attention’s\\napproximation quality is good.\\n6.2.2\\npretraining + few label finetune (Multi-variate classification)\\nThe results shown in Table 3 get us the following observation:\\n(1) Pretraining is effective. Pretraining always leads to better\\naccuracy than training with a few labels from scratch. In particular,\\non WISDM data all the methods using RITA architecture increase\\nthe accuracy by at least 10%. This is impressive considering we do\\nnot have a very large unlabeled pre-training set to use.\\n(2) RITA’s advantage over TST. our Group Attn. and other\\nthree baselines using RITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and\\nLinformer) significantly outperform TST on all four classification\\ndatasets by 25 percentage points.\\n(3) Group Attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on 3\\nout of 4 datasets. When compared to Vanilla, Group Attn. is better\\non HHAR and ECG, and comparable on the other two, further con-\\nfirming its high quality on approximation. Further, we notice that\\nLinformer struggles in this setting: in average its accuracy is worse\\nthan Vanilla by 8.22% and Group Attn. by 8.01%. This is because the\\nlow-rank projection operation introduces extra model parameters,\\nmaking Linformer more easily overfit, while overfitting is especially\\nharmful when there are only a few labeled training samples.\\n6.2.3\\nfull-dataset training (Multi-variate imputation)\\nSimilar to classification tasks, the results of imputation tasks\\n(Table.2) show that Group Attn. consistently outperforms the base-\\nlines in training time while achieving comparable/better MSE. Again,\\non the large dataset MGH (length = 10,000), TST and Vanilla fail due\\nto out of memory (OOM) errors. Methods using RITA framework\\n(Group Attn., Performer, Linformer) all achieve very low MSE (are\\nhighly accurate). Among them Linformer is the worst.\\n6.3\\nEfficiency: Transformer-based Methods\\nWe measure the efficiency by the average training time per epoch\\nincluding the cost of the forward computation + backward propaga-\\ntion and the grouping overhead. We first show the results on all the\\n5 datasets in Sec. 6.3.1. We then vary the length of the timeseries\\non the MGH dataset to show group attention’s scalability on long\\ntimeseries in Sec. 6.3.2.\\n6.3.1\\nTraining Time: All Multi-variate Datasets\\nThe results in Fig. 3(b) and Table 2 lead to the below observations:\\n(1) Vanilla Self-Attention is not scalable. In average, it takes\\n2-3 minutes to train one epoch when the length of the timeseries is\\nonly 200 (WISDM, HHAR, RWHAR), takes over 15 minutes when\\nthe length increases to 2,000 (ECG), and fails on the long MGH data\\nwhen the length reaches 10,000 due to out of GPU memory.\\n(2) Group Attn.’s advantage over all other attention mecha-\\nnisms. As we have shown in Sec. 6.2, Group Attn. is more accurate\\n7\\nDataset\\nLength\\nTST [61]\\nVanilla\\nPerformer\\nLinformer\\nGroup Attn.\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nWISDM\\n200\\n13.30\\n150.3\\n3.240\\n178.1\\n3.449\\n162.6\\n3.852\\n141.9\\n3.277\\n136.7\\nHHAR\\n200\\n1.085\\n78.2\\n0.2968\\n97.4\\n0.2980\\n82.6\\n0.3198\\n81.1\\n0.2974\\n73.3\\nRWHAR\\n200\\n0.0882\\n83.9\\n0.0478\\n108.1\\n0.0489\\n89.1\\n0.0572\\n98.4\\n0.0478\\n81.3\\nECG\\n2000\\n0.0905\\n696.3\\n0.0037\\n857.9\\n0.0033\\n270.2\\n0.0035\\n291.38\\n0.0038\\n164.36\\nMGH\\n10000\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.00014\\n356.2\\n0.00088\\n404.9\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nTable 2: Imputation results (multi-variate data).

With comparable MSE, Group Attn. outperforms\\nVanilla by 63X. Moreover, as the length increases from 2000 to 10000,\\nthe training time of Group Attn. only increases from 31.2 seconds\\nto 54.4 seconds per epoch. The reason is that as the timeseires\\nbecomes longer, there are more grouping opportunities because of\\nthe similarity of the timeseries segments.\\nAccuracy\\nTraining Time/sec\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure 5: Comparison to non-deep learning method (uni-\\nvariate data).\\n6.4\\nComparison to Non-deep Learning Methods\\nWe compare against GRAIL, the SOTA of non-deep learning time-\\nseries representation learning.

We\\nvary 𝑁and the error bound threshold 𝜖used by RITA.\\nFrom the results in Table 4 we get the following observations:\\n(1) Adaptive Scheduler is better than fixed 𝑁. Training with\\nAdaptive Scheduler already achieves better or comparable perfor-\\nmance compared to the best performing 𝑁. More specifically, on\\nthe MGH dataset, dynamic scheduler always achieves better accu-\\nracy and is much faster compared to fixed 𝑁. On the ECG dataset,\\nalthough fixed 𝑁is slightly better than adaptive scheduler in accu-\\nracy when setting the N as 512, it runs much slower than adaptive\\nscheduler.

To get empirical results, we pretrain\\nRITA on WISDM dataset with 20%/40%/60%/80% of the pretraining\\ndata and finetune each pretrained model with 100 labels per class.\\nThe results in Table 5 show that: (1) The more pretraining data,\\nthe larger the improvement. The accuracy increases with the\\nsizes of the pretraining data; (2) Marginal utility diminishing.\\nThe first 20% pretraining data gives a 10.38% improvement in accu-\\nracy (72.94% vs 62.56%), while the remaining 80% pretraining data\\nonly gives an additional improvement of 2.12% (75.06% vs 72.94%).\\n7\\nRELATED WORK\\n7.1\\nTimeseries Analytics\\nThere is a great deal of prior work on timeseries analytics methods.\\nThis work can be divided into three categories: (1) non-deep learn-\\ning methods; (2) CNN/RNN-based deep learning methods; and (3)\\nTransformer-based deep learning methods.\\nTraditional Methods. These methods, such as TS-CHIEF [45],\\nHIVE-COTE [33], ROCKET [15] have achieved notable performance\\non public datasets. Despite that, traditional methods suffer from\\none or more issues: they (1) rely on expert knowledge for feature\\nextraction; (2) incur heavy computation cost and are inappropriate\\nfor GPU devices; (3) support only uni-variate timeseries; (4) perform\\nclassification solely. Some work [61] shows that the transformed-\\nbased methods outperform these traditional methods especially on\\nmulti-variate timeseries.\\nIn particular, as the SOTA of timeseries representation learn-\\ning, GRAIL [40] extracts landmarks from data and computes the\\nrepresentations with the combination of the landmarks. However,\\nGRAIL only supports uni-variate timeseries. Our experiments (Sec. 6.4)\\nshow that RITA significantly outperforms GRAIL in both effective-\\nness and efficiency on uni-variate timeseries.\\nCNN/RNN-based Deep Learning Methods. CNN-based methods,\\nsuch as InceptionTime [21] and Resnet [19], are good at classifica-\\ntion tasks, but can not handle generative tasks such as forecasting\\nbecause of the inductive bias of convolution networks. RNN-based\\nmethods, such as Brit [7] and deepAR [44], are capable for classifi-\\ncation, regression and generation. However, the recurrent structure\\nbrings a lot of problems: (1) limiting the model’s ability in captur-\\ning long-range correlation; (2) notoriously difficult to train [41]\\nbecause of gradient vanishing and exploding problem. As a result,\\nsuch methods can hardly scale to very long timeseries.\\nTransformer-based Deep Learning Methods. Given that Trans-\\nformer is the best choice for backbone in almost all sequence mod-\\neling tasks, some effort has been made to apply Transformer to\\ntimeseries analytics. Targeting forecasting of uni-variate timeseries,\\nLogTrans [30] introduced a log sparsity assumption to attention\\ncomputation. Informer [62] pushes LogTrans a step further and\\nscales forecasting to multi-variate timeseries. Autoformer [57] per-\\nforms forecasting by decomposing timeseries into two parts, i.e.\\nthe trend part and the seasonal part.\\nFor imputation tasks, CDSA [37] outperforms statistical meth-\\nods and the SOTA of RNN-based method Brit [7] on 3 public and\\n2 competition datasets. For timeseries classification, AutoTrans-\\nformer [43] performs architecture search to adapt to the tasks\\nin different domains. For timeseries anomaly detection, Anomaly\\nTransformer [58] outperforms many widely-used methods such\\nas OmniAnomaly [47], assuming the attention score maps show\\nGaussian distribution.\\nAll of these works are designed for specific tasks, rather than\\nfunctioning as a representation learning framework to serve\\ndifferent downstream tasks. To fill this gap, some researchers pro-\\nposed a Transformer-based architecture, called TST [61]. Like RITA,\\nTST supports regression, classification, and unsupervised learning\\nthrough the “cloze test” pretraining task on timeseries. However,\\nTST directly uses the classical Vanilla self-attention, thus not scal-\\nable to long timeseries as shown in our experiments (Sec. 6.3.2).\\n7.2\\nEfficient Transformers\\nThe need of improving the scalability of Transformers has led to\\nmore efficient variations of Transformers, especially for accommo-\\ndating long text data in NLP [49].\\nIntroducing fixed/random patterns to self-attention mechanism\\nis an intuitive idea. Sparse Transformer [9] and Longformer [3] only\\ncompute attention at fixed intervals. ETC [2] and BigBird [60] use\\nglobal-local attention: the attention computation is limited within\\na fixed radius, while some auxiliary tokens are added to attend/get\\nattended globally. The deficiencies of fixed attention patterns are\\nobvious: it heavily depends on users to give an optimal setting.\\nTo decrease the reliance on human labor, some works seek to\\nintroduce learnable/adaptive attention patterns instead of fixed\\npatterns. Reformer [26] proposed only computing the dominant\\nattention terms based on their observation of sparsity in atten-\\ntion matrix from language/image data. Such sparsity is intuitive\\nin language data, in which a word’s attention mainly focuses on\\nthe nearby sentences. However, attention in timeseries data shows\\nstrong seasonal patterns rather than sparse patterns, mainly as\\n9\\nresult of the periodicity of timeseries data. Therefore, such works\\ndo not work well for timeseries.\\nApart from introducing attention patterns, some works seek\\nto solve this problem with applied mathematics techniques. Lin-\\nformer [54] performs a projection to decrease the size of query,\\nkey and value matrices before attention computation, because the\\nattention matrix tends to be low-ranked. Performer [10] uses linear\\nfunctions to approximate the kernel function softmax, making at-\\ntention computation commutative. When the sequence length is far\\ngreater than the dimension of embedding vectors, Performer ben-\\nefits from changing the order of matrix multiplication. Linformer\\nand Performer do not depend on the unique properties of language\\ndata, thus potentially fitting timeseries better than other techniques,\\nwhich is why we compared against them in our experiments. How-\\never as shown in Sec. 6, our group attention significantly outper-\\nforms them in both accuracy and efficiency (training time), because\\ngroup attention fully leverages the periodicity of timeseries.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we presented RITA, an automatic, self-supervised, and\\nscalable timeseries analytics tool. RITA effectively adapts Trans-\\nformer, popular in NLP, into timeseries analytics. As the key com-\\nponent of RITA, group attention eliminates the performance bottle-\\nneck of the classical self-attention mechanisms, thus successfully\\nscaling RITA to highly complex, long timeseries data. Our experi-\\nments confirm that RITA significantly speeds up the state-of-the-art\\nby 63X with a better accuracy.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen,\\nCraig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al.\\n2016.

We scale the values of all timeseries to non-negative\\nand use a special value (-1) to indicate missing values:\\n𝑇𝑜(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n−1\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝑀\\n𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∉𝑀\\n(17)\\n𝑇𝑜is fed into the RITA as input, and the output representa-\\ntions are concatenated and fed into a Transpose Convolution layer\\nwhich decodes the output embedding vectors from hidden space to\\ntimeseries values, corresponding to the convolution operation in\\n13\\nthe input stage, i.e., Y = TransposeCNN (Z1 +○Z2 +○... +○Zn), where\\n𝑌∈R𝑡×𝑚is the recovered timeseries, and 𝑍𝑖∈R𝑑is the output of\\neach position.\\nHere Mean Square Error is chosen as the loss function [51]:\\n𝐿=\\n1\\n|𝑀|\\nÍ\\n(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝑀(𝑌(𝑖, 𝑗) −𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗))2.\\nA.7.3\\nForecasting\\nForecasting can be regarded as a special case of imputation, in\\nwhich all missing values are at the end of timeseries.\\nSo like in imputation task, we scale the timeseries to non-\\nnegative and use a special value (-1) to indicate the values to be\\npredicted:\\n𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n𝑖≤𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑\\n−1\\n𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒\\n(18)\\nWhere 𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑is the observed timestamp.

The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\\nAs of 2024, the paper has been cited more than 140,000 times.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryōsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Love\\nSummary: \"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967, with \"Baby, You\\'re a Rich Man\" as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain\\'s contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were shown performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon\\'s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show\\'s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture\\'s embrace of flower power philosophy.\\nOur World coincide'),\n",

Introduction\\nThe ubiquitous deployment of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) results in ever-growing amounts of compute spent\\non inference (Patterson et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Kad-\\ndour et al., 2023a; Xia et al., 2024; Reid et al., 2024). Fur-\\nther, serving models with low latencies remains challenging\\nbecause contemporary Transformer architectures employ\\nthe self-attention mechanism with quadratic input complex-\\nity (Touvron et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we delve deeper into the concept of layer\\nskipping (Fan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022a) to reduce\\nthe computation on superfluous LLM components. Our\\nfindings demonstrate that pruning deeper attention layers\\ndoes not significantly affect performance. When applied\\nto Llama-v2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we maintain good\\nperformance on the OpenLLM (ARC (Clark et al., 2018),\\n*Equal contribution\\n1University College London,\\nUK\\n2University of Edinburgh, UK.

Layer skipping\\nConsider a Transformer model M with L layers, each\\nconsisting of an attention sub-layer followed by a multi-\\nlayer perceptron (MLP) sub-layer. We denote each layer as\\nMi = (Attentioni, MLPi) for i ∈{1, 2, . . . , L}.\\nTo compare the performance of Transformer models when\\nskipping specific sub-layers, we create two variants of the\\nmodel:\\n1. Skipping MLP Layers: We construct a model Mskip MLP\\n1\\narXiv:2407.15516v1  [cs.LG]  22 Jul 2024\\nAttention Is All You Need But You Don’t Need All Of It\\nby skipping the MLP sub-layer from the last k layers. The\\nresulting model is Mskip MLP = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(Attentioni, ∅) | i ∈{L −k +\\n1, . . . , L}}.\\n2. Skipping Attention Layers: We construct a model\\nMskip Attention by skipping the attention sub-layer from the\\nlast k layers.\\nThe resulting model is Mskip Attention =\\n{(Attentioni, MLPi)\\n|\\ni\\n∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪\\n{(∅, MLPi) | i ∈{L −k + 1, . . . , L}}.\\n3.

The re-\\nsulting model is Mskip Block = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(∅) | i ∈{L −k + 1, . . . , L}}.\\nWe then evaluate the performance of these modified models\\non the OpenLLM benchmark (Beeching et al., 2023), com-\\nparing metrics such as accuracy, computational efficiency,\\nand memory usage. This comparison helps in understand-\\ning the individual contributions of the attention and MLP\\nsub-layers to the overall performance of the Transformer\\nmodel.\\n(a) Skip attention lay-\\ners.\\n(b) Skip attention lay-\\ners,\\nkeep last full\\nblock.\\n(c) Skip ffwd layers.\\n(d) Skip ffwd layers,\\nkeep last full block.\\n(e) Skip full blocks.\\n(f) Skip full blocks,\\nkeep last full block.\\nFigure 2. Skip mechanisms for skipping single layers and entire\\nTransformer blocks (ffwd and attention layers) during inference.\\n2.2. Motivation: Are Deeper Layers More Redundant?\\nIn Transformer models, the last layers have been shown to\\ncontribute less information than earlier layers, making it\\npossible to drop those layers at a minimal performance cost\\n(Fan et al., 2019; Zhang & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022a;\\nSchuster et al., 2022; Kaddour et al., 2023b; Belrose et al.,\\n2023).\\nTo verify this, we experiment with removing either the at-\\ntention sublayers or the MLP sublayers. Figure 1 shows the\\ncosine similarities between a layer’s features and the previ-\\nous layer showing that deeper layers have a lower impact\\non the features than earlier layers. One notable exception\\nto this trend is that the last layer for both Llama-v2 7B and\\n13B has the lowest cosine similarity with the previous layer.\\nPrevious analysis of the attention mechanism has shown\\nthat they can converge to the same value due to attention\\ncollapse (Zhai et al., 2023) and token features that also con-\\nverge to the same value due to over-smoothing (Wang et al.,\\n2022b; Dovonon et al., 2024) or rank collapse (Dong et al.,\\n2023), with solutions to these issues typically improving\\nperformance (Ali et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2024).\\n3. Results\\nExperimental Setup\\nFor all experiments, we use either\\nLlama-v2-7B or Llama-v2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a;b),\\ntwo LLMs trained on trillions of publically available tokens.\\nWe experiment with keeping 66%, 75%, 90% and 100% of\\nthe network and report the corresponding results in Table 1.\\nWe also experiment with removing attention sublayers in\\nTable 2, MLP sublayers in Table 3, and a varying number of\\nlayers similar to Table 1 but keeping the last layer in Table 4.\\n3.1.

Related Work\\nEarly Exit during inference\\nEarly exit methods have also\\nbeen proposed in other domains (Graves, 2017; Teerapit-\\ntayanon et al., 2017) before getting adapted to autoregressive\\nmodels (Elbayad et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2022; Din et al.,\\n2023; Elhoushi et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\\n2024). The idea works by dynamically allocating compute\\nbased on the difficulty of the input sequence. Our method\\nprunes the deepest layers and does not involve any level of\\nadaptability. This is beneficial because it does not require\\nthe entire model to be loaded in memory. Dropping layers\\nduring inference has been done on BERT-like models in\\n(Wang et al., 2022a; Sajjad et al., 2023). We apply a similar\\nanalysis to more recent LLMs and study the impact of skip-\\nping attention and/or MLP layers in more detail. Concurrent\\nwork to ours by Gromov et al. (2024) yields similar results\\nby pruning deeper layers and applying fine-tuning on the\\npruned model.\\nLayer dropping/growing during training\\nThere are var-\\nious works studying the dropping/growing layers dynami-\\ncally during training (Fan et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019;\\nKaddour et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). In\\ncontrast, this work focuses on dropping layers of an already\\npre-trained model in a way similar to Men et al. (2024).\\nOther Inference Speedup Methods\\nOther works to speed\\nup inference include compressing KV caches (Nawrot et al.,\\n2024; Wu & Tu, 2024; Bi et al., 2024), speculative decoding\\n(Chen et al., 2023), efficient memory management (Kwon\\net al., 2023), or subqudratic attention architectures (Fu et al.,\\n2022; Peng et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2023), an overview has\\nbeen provided by Kaddour et al. (2023a).\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe investigated the effect of dropping the last layers from\\nthe 7B and 13B Llama2 models. We observe that dropping\\nattention sublayers lead to much lower drops in performance\\nthan dropping the MLP sublayers, whether the last layer\\nis included or not, while also leading to better inference\\nspeedups. For example, removing 33% of attention layers\\nleads to an 18% speedup in a 13B Llama2 model at the cost\\nof a 1.8% drop in average performance. This shows that\\nmassive improvements can be made over dropping entire\\nlayers from just dropping the attention sublayer.\\nReferences\\nAli, A., Galanti, T., and Wolf, L.

Introduction\\nInstance-level image retrieval is at the core of visual rep-\\nresentation learning and is connected with many problems\\nof visual recognition and machine learning, for instance\\nmetric learning [30, 26], few-shot learning [42] and unsu-\\npervised learning [8]. Many large-scale open datasets [3,\\n37, 16, 29, 53], and competitions1 have accelerated progress\\nin instance-level image retrieval, which has been trans-\\nformed by deep learning [3].\\nMany studies on instance-level image retrieval focus\\non learning features from convolutional neural networks\\n(CNN), while others focus on re-ranking, for instance by\\ngraph-based methods [11]. The former can be distinguished\\naccording to feature types: local descriptors, reminiscent of\\nSIFT [27], where an image is mapped to a few hundred vec-\\ntors; and global descriptors, where an image is mapped to a\\n1https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020\\nsingle vector. In fact, deep learning has brought global de-\\nscriptors with astounding performance, while allowing efﬁ-\\ncient search. Our study belongs to this type.\\nStudies on global descriptors have focused on spatial\\npooling [2, 37]. The need for compact, discriminative rep-\\nresentations that are resistant to clutter has naturally given\\nrise to spatial attention methods [24, 28]. Different kinds\\nof attention have been studied in many areas of computer\\nvision research. There is also channel attention [20, 9]; lo-\\ncal attention, applied independently to elements of the rep-\\nresentation (feature map) [54, 25]; global attention, based\\non interaction between elements [52, 9]; and combinations\\nthereof. Unfortunately, each study has been limited to one or\\ntwo kinds of attention only; attention is not always learned;\\nand applications vary.\\nIt is the objective of our work to perform a compre-\\nhensive study of all forms of attention above, apply them\\nto instance-level image retrieval and provide a detailed ac-\\ncount of their interaction and impact on performance. As\\nshown in Figure 1, we collect contextual information from\\nimages with both local and global attention, giving rise to\\ntwo parallel network streams. Importantly, each operates\\non both spatial locations and feature channels. Local at-\\ntention is about individual locations and channels; global is\\nabout interaction between locations and between channels.\\nThe extracted information is separately embedded in local\\nand global attention feature maps, which are combined in a\\nglobal-local attention feature map before pooling.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We propose a novel network that consists of both\\nglobal and local attention for image retrieval. This is\\nthe ﬁrst study that employs both mechanisms.\\n2. Each of the global and local attention mechanisms\\ncomprises both spatial and channel attention.\\n3. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical\\nevidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and\\nimprove the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n1\\narXiv:2107.08000v1  [cs.CV]  16 Jul 2021\\nAl\\nc\\nc × 1 × 1\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\nc\\nAl\\ns\\n1 × h × w\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\n×\\nc × h × w\\nF\\n×\\n+\\nc × h × w\\nFgl\\nAg\\nc\\nc × c\\n×\\nFg\\nc\\nAg\\ns\\nhw × hw\\n×\\n+\\nFg\\n×\\nwl\\nw\\nwg\\nchannel attention\\nspatial attention\\nfusion\\nlocal attention\\nglobal attention\\nFigure 1: Our global-local attention module (GLAM) involves both channel and spatial attention, as well as both local atten-\\ntion (channels/locations weighted independently, based on contextual information obtained by pooling) and global attention\\n(based on pairwise interaction between channels/locations). As a result, four attention maps are used: local channel (Al\\nc),\\nlocal spatial (Al\\ns), global channel (Ag\\nc) and global spatial (Ag\\ns). The input feature map F is weighted into local (Fl) and\\nglobal (Fg) attention feature maps, which are fused with F to yield the global-local attention feature map Fgl.

Related work\\nInstance-level image retrieval\\nStudies on instance-level\\nimage retrieval can be roughly, but not exclusively, di-\\nvided into three types: (1) studies on global descriptors\\n[3, 16, 24, 53, 2, 37]; (2) studies on local descriptors and\\ngeometry-based re-ranking [29, 45, 40, 53]; (3) re-ranking\\nby graph-based methods [11, 21, 55]. The ﬁrst two types\\nof studies focus on the feature representation, while the last\\ntype focuses on re-ranking extracted features.\\nStudies on global descriptors focus on spatial pooling\\nof CNN feature maps into vectors, including MAC [38],\\nSPoC [2], CroW [24], R-MAC [48, 15, 16], GeM [37],\\nand NetVLAD [1, 25], as well as learning the representa-\\ntion [3, 15, 16, 36, 37]. Studies before deep learning dom-\\ninated image retrieval were mostly based on local descrip-\\ntors like SIFT [27] and bag-of-words representation [32] or\\naggregated descriptors like VLAD [22] or ASMK [46]. Lo-\\ncal descriptors have been revived in deep learning, e.g. with\\nDELF [29], DELG [5] and ASMK extensions [45, 47].\\nWe focus on learning a global descriptor in this work, be-\\ncause it is the most efﬁcient in terms of storage and search.\\nHowever, our generic attention mechanism produces a fea-\\nture tensor and could be applicable to local descriptors as\\nwell, if global pooling were replaced by local feature detec-\\ntion. Re-ranking methods are complementary to the repre-\\nsentation and we do not consider them in this work.\\nAttention\\nAttention mechanisms have been ﬁrst proposed\\nin image classiﬁcation studies focusing on channel at-\\nMETHOD\\nLOCAL\\nGLOBAL\\nLRN RET\\nSpatial Channel Spatial Channel\\nSENet [20]\\n✓\\n✓\\nECA-Net [51]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGCNet [6]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCBAM [54]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nGE [19]\\n✓\\n✓\\nNL-Net [52]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAA-Net [4]\\n✓\\n✓\\nSAN [59]\\n✓\\n✓\\nN3Net [34]\\n✓\\n✓\\nA2-Net [9]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGSoP [14]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOnA [23]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAGeM [17]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCroW [24]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nCRN [25]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELF [29]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELG [5]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nTolias et al.

CRN [25] ap-\\nplies spatial attention for feature reweighting and is learned.\\nLearned spatial attention mechanisms are common for local\\ndescriptors [29, 5, 47].\\nWe call the above methods local attention, in the sense\\nthat elements of the feature tensor (channels / spatial loca-\\ntions), are weighted independently, based on contextual in-\\nformation obtained by pooling or learned. By constrast, by\\nglobal attention we refer to mechanisms that model inter-\\naction between elements of the feature tensor, for example\\nbetween channels or between locations.\\nIn image classiﬁcation, non-local neural network (NL-\\nNet) [52] is maybe the ﬁrst global attention mechanism, fol-\\nlowed by similar studies [4, 59, 34]. It is global spatial at-\\ntention, allowing interaction between any pair of spatial lo-\\ncations. Similarly, there are studies of global channel atten-\\ntion, allowing interaction between channels [9, 14]. Global\\nattention has focused mostly on image recognition and has\\nbeen applied to either spatial or channel attention so far, not\\nboth. In image retrieval, SOLAR [28] is a direct application\\nof the global spatial attention mechanism of [52].\\nTable 1 attempts to categorize related work on atten-\\ntion according to whether attention is local or global, spa-\\ntial or channel, whether it is learned and whether it is ap-\\nplied to instance-level image retrieval. We observe that all\\nmethods limit to one or two forms of attention only. Of\\nthose studies that focus on image retrieval, many are not\\nlearned [23, 17, 24], and of those that are, some are de-\\nsigned for local descriptors [29, 47].\\nBy contrast, we provide a comprehensive study of all\\nforms of attention, global and local, spatial and channel, to\\nobtain a learned representation in the form of a tensor that\\ncan be used in any way. We spatially pool it into a global\\ndescriptor and we study the relative gain of different forms\\nof attention in image retrieval.\\nfeature map\\nconv 1 × 1\\nconv 3 × 3\\nconv 5 × 5\\nconv 7 × 7\\nconcat\\nconv 1 × 1\\nattention map\\nc × h × w\\n4c′ × h × w\\n1 × h × w\\nc′ × h × w\\ndilated\\nconv\\nF\\nF′\\nAl\\ns\\nFigure 3: Local spatial attention.

Global-local attention\\nWe design a global-local attention module (GLAM),\\nwhich is attached at the end of a backbone network. Figure 1\\nillustrates its main components. We are given a c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F, where c is the number of channels, and\\nh × w is the spatial resolution. Local attention collects con-\\ntext from the image and applies pooling to obtain a c×1×1\\nlocal channel attention map Al\\nc and a 1 × h × w local spa-\\ntial attention map Al\\ns. Global attention allows interaction\\nbetween channels, resulting in a c × c global channel at-\\ntention map Ag\\nc, and between spatial locations, resulting in\\na hw × hw global spatial attention map Ag\\ns. The feature\\nmaps produced by the two attention streams are combined\\nwith the original one by a learned fusion mechanism into\\nthe global-local attention feature map Fgl before being spa-\\ntially pooled into a global image descriptor.\\n3.1. Local attention\\nWe extract an 1D channel and a 2D spatial attention map\\nto weigh the feature map in the corresponding dimensions.\\nLocal channel attention\\nFollowing ECA-Net [51], this\\nattention captures local channel information. As shown in\\nFigure 2, we are given a c×h×w feature tensor F from our\\nbackbone. We ﬁrst reduce it to a c × 1 × 1 tensor by global\\naverage pooling (GAP). Channel attention is then captured\\nby a 1D convolution of kernel size k along the channel di-\\nmension, where k controls the extent of cross-channel inter-\\naction. This is followed by a sigmoid function, resulting in\\nthe c × 1 × 1 local channel attention map Al\\nc.\\nLocal spatial attention\\nInspired by the inception mod-\\nule [43] and similar to [25], this attention map captures local\\nspatial information at different scales.

We then extract local spatial\\ncontextual information using convolutional ﬁlters of kernel\\nsize 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7, which are efﬁciently imple-\\nmented by 3 × 3 dilated convolutions [7, 57] with dilation\\nparameter 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The resulting features,\\nalong with one obtained by 1 × 1 convolution on F′, are\\nconcatenated into a 4c′ × h × w tensor. Finally, we obtain\\nthe 1 × h × w local spatial attention map Al\\ns by a 1 × 1\\nconvolution that reduces the channel dimension to 1.\\nThe middle column of Figure 6 shows heat maps of local\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nLocal attention feature map\\nWe use the local channel\\nattention map Al\\nc to weigh F in the channel dimension\\nFl\\nc := F ⊙Al\\nc + F.\\n(1)\\nWe then use local spatial attention map Al\\ns to weigh Fl\\nc\\nin the spatial dimensions, resulting in the c × h × w local\\nattention feature map\\nFl = Fl\\nc ⊙Al\\ns + Fl\\nc.\\n(2)\\nHere, A⊙B denotes an element-wise multiplication of ten-\\nsors A and B, with broadcasting when one tensor is smaller.\\nWe adopt the choice of applying channel followed by spa-\\ntial attention from convolutional block attention module\\nCBAM [54]. However, apart from computing Al\\ns at differ-\\nent scales, both attention maps are obtained from the orig-\\ninal tensor F rather than sequentially. In addition, both (1)\\nand (2) include residual connections, while CBAM includes\\na single residual connection over both steps.\\n3.2.

This mechanism is based on the non-local neural net-\\nwork [52], but with the idea of 1D convolution from ECA-\\nNet [51]. As shown in Figure 4, we are given the c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F from our backbone. We apply GAP and\\nsqueeze spatial dimensions, followed by a 1D convolution\\nof kernel size k and a sigmoid function, to obtain 1×c query\\nQc and key Kc tensors. The value tensor Vc is obtained by\\nmere reshaping of F to hw×c, without GAP. Next, we form\\nthe outer product of Kc and Qc, followed by softmax over\\nchannels to obtain a c × c global channel attention map\\nAg\\nc = softmax(Kc\\n⊤Qc).\\n(3)\\nFinally, this attention map is multiplied with Vc and the ma-\\ntrix product VcAg\\nc is reshaped back to c×h×w to give the\\nglobal channel attention feature map Gc. In GSoP [14] and\\nA2-Net [9], a c×c global channel attention map is obtained\\nby multiplication of hw × c matrices; (3) is more efﬁcient,\\nusing only an outer product of 1 × c vectors.\\nGlobal spatial attention\\nSince ordinary convolution ap-\\nplies only a local neighborhood at a time, it cannot capture\\nglobal contextual information. Thus, we apply non-local ﬁl-\\ntering [52], which is a form of self-attention [49] in the spa-\\ntial dimensions. As shown in Figure 5, we are given the\\nsame c × h × w feature tensor F from our backbone. By\\nusing three 1×1 convolutions, which reduce channels to c′,\\nand ﬂattening spatial dimensions to hw, we obtain c′ × hw\\nquery Qs, key Ks, and value Vs tensors, where each col-\\numn is a feature vector corresponding to a particular spatial\\nlocation. We capture pairwise similarities of these vectors\\nby matrix multiplication of Ks and Qs, followed by soft-\\nmax over locations to obtain a hw × hw global spatial at-\\ntention map:\\nAg\\ns = softmax(K⊤\\ns Qs).\\n(4)\\n4\\nThis attention map is multiplied with Vs and the matrix\\nproduct VsAg\\ns is reshaped back to c′ ×h×w by expanding\\nthe spatial dimensions. Finally, using a 1 × 1 convolution,\\nwhich increases channels back to c, we obtain the c×h×w\\nglobal spatial attention feature map Gs.\\nThe right column of Figure 6 shows heat maps for global\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nGlobal attention feature map\\nWe use the global channel\\nattention feature map Fc to weigh F element-wise\\nFg\\nc = F ⊙Gc.\\n(5)\\nWe then use global spatial attention feature map Gs to\\nweigh Fg\\nc element-wise, resulting in the c × h × w global\\nattention feature map\\nFg = Fg\\nc ⊙Gs + Fg\\nc.\\n(6)\\nSimilarly to Fl in (1) and (2), we apply channel attention\\nﬁrst, followed by spatial attention. However, unlike (1),\\nthere is no residual connection in (5). This choice is sup-\\nported by early experiments.\\n3.3. Global-local attention\\nFeature fusion\\nAs shown in Figure 1, we combine the\\nlocal and global attention feature maps, Fl and Fg, with\\nthe original feature F. While concatenation and summation\\nare common operations for feature combination, we use a\\nweighted average with weights wl, wg, w respectively, ob-\\ntained by softmax over three learnable scalar parameters, to\\nobtain a c × h × w global-local attention feature map\\nFgl = wlFl + wgFl + wF.\\n(7)\\nEfﬁcientDet [44] has shown that this is the most effective,\\namong a number of choices, for fusion of features across\\ndifferent scales.\\nPooling\\nWe apply GeM [37], a learnable spatial pooling\\nmechanism, to feature map Fgl (7), followed by a fully-\\nconnected (FC) layer with dropout and batch normalization.\\nThe ﬁnal embedding is obtained by ℓ2-normalization.\\n4. Experiments\\n4.1. Datasets\\nTraining set\\nThere are a number of open landmark\\ndatasets commonly used for training in image retrieval stud-\\nies, including neural code (NC) [3], neural code clean (NC-\\nclean) [16], as well as Google Landmarks v1 (GLDv1) [29]\\nand v2 (GLDv2) [53]. Table 2 shows relevant statistics.\\nThese datasets can be categorized into noisy and clean. The\\nclean sets were obtained from the original noisy sets for\\nmore effective training [16, 53]. The original noisy datasets\\nare much larger, but they have high intra-class variability.\\n(a) input\\n(b) local\\n(c) global\\nFigure 6: Local and global spatial attention. Left: input\\nimages. Middle: local spatial attention heat maps. Right:\\nglobal spatial attention heat maps. Red (blue) means higher\\n(lower) attention weight.\\nEach class can include visually dissimilar images such as\\nexterior and interior views of a building or landmark, in-\\ncluding ﬂoor plans and paintings inside. The clean datasets\\nfocus on views directly relevant to landmark recognition but\\nhave a much smaller number of images.\\nEvaluation set and metrics\\nWe use four common eval-\\nuation datasets for landmark image retrieval: Oxford5k\\n(Ox5k) [32], Paris6k (Par6k) [33], as well as Revisited Ox-\\nford (ROxford or ROxf) and Paris (RParis or RPar) [35].\\nROxford and RParis are used with and without one million\\ndistractors (R1M) [28] and evaluated using the Medium and\\nHard protocols [35]. We evaluate using mean Average Pre-\\ncision (mAP) and mean precision at 10 (mP@10).\\n4.2. Implementation details\\nWe train on 8 TITAN RTX 2080Ti GPUs. All models are\\npre-trained on ImageNet [39] and implemented in PyTorch\\n[31]. For fair comparisons, we set a training environment\\n5\\nFigure 7: Examples of our ranking results. In each row, the ﬁrst image on the left (pink dotted outline) is a query image with a\\ntarget object (red crop box), and the following are the top ranking images for the query. Orange solid outline: positive images\\nfor the query; red solid outline: negative.\\nsimilar to the those of compared studies [56, 53, 28, 35]. We\\nemploy ResNet101 [18] as a backbone model. The kernel\\nsize k of ECANet in subsection 3.1 is set to 3. The param-\\neter p of GeM in subsection 3.3 is set to 3 and the dimen-\\nsion d of ﬁnal embeddings to 512. We adopt ArcFace [10],\\na cosine-softmax based loss, with a margin of 0.3. We use\\nstochastic gradient descent with initial learning rate 10−3,\\nmomentum 0.9 and weight decay 10−5.\\nWe adopt the batch sampling of Yokoo et al. [56] where\\nmini-batch samples with similar aspect ratios are resized to\\na particular size. Here, we use a batch size of 64. For image\\naugmentation, we apply scaling, random cropping, and var-\\nied illumination. At inference, we apply a multi-resolution\\nrepresentation [16] to query and database images.\\nOur method is denoted as GLAM (global-local atten-\\ntion module). Using the backbone model alone is referred\\nto as baseline. It is compatible with recent models based\\non ResNet101-GeM trained with ArcFace [53, 28]. Adding\\nour local attention (subsection 3.1) to the baseline model is\\ndenoted +local, while adding our global attention (subsec-\\ntion 3.2) is denoted +global. Since we focus on representa-\\ntion learning, we do not consider post-processing methods\\nlike geometry-based re-ranking [29, 40, 53] or graph-based\\nre-ranking [11, 21, 55].\\n4.3.

Since GLDv2-clean is relatively\\nnew, Weyand et al. [53], which introduced the dataset, is the\\nonly study that has trained the same backbone with the same\\nsettings (ResNet101-GeM with ArcFace) on GLDv2-clean.\\nOur baseline is lower than [53], because our dimensinality is\\n512, while other models based on ResNet101 use 2048. Yet,\\nTable 3 shows that our best model trained on GLDv2-clean\\noutperforms [53] by a large margin. But the most impor-\\ntant comparison is with SOLAR [28], also based on self-\\nattention, which has trained ResNet101-GeM on GLDv1-\\nnoisy. On this training set, our best model clearly outper-\\nforms [28] despite lower dimensionality.\\nComparison with state of the art\\nTable 4 shows the\\nperformance of four variants of our model, i.e. baseline\\nwith or without local/global attention, and compares them\\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on global de-\\nscriptors without re-ranking on the complete set of bench-\\nmarks, including distractors. Both local and global atten-\\ntion bring signiﬁcant gain over the baseline. The effect\\nof global is stronger, while the gain of the two is addi-\\ntive in the combination.

Table 5 shows the results, which are more ﬁne-\\ngrained than those of Table 4. In particular, it shows the ef-\\nfect of the channel and spatial variants of both local and\\nglobal attention. We observe that, when used alone, the\\nchannel and spatial variants of local attention are harmful\\nin most cases. Even the combination, baseline+local, is not\\nalways effective. By contrast, when used alone, the channel\\nand spatial variants of global attention are mostly beneﬁcial,\\nespecially the latter. Their combination, baseline+global, is\\nimpressive, bringing gain of up to 7.5%. Importantly, the\\ncombination baseline+global+local improves further by up\\nto another 2.8%. This result shows the necessity of local\\nattention in the ﬁnal model.\\nCBAM vs. our local spatial attention\\nWe experiment\\nwith the local spatial attention of CBAM [54]. CBAM ap-\\nplies average and max-pooling to input features and con-\\ncatenates the two for spatial attention. We apply this vari-\\nant to our local spatial attention module for comparison.\\nFor the CBAM style module, we keep the overall design\\nof our module as shown in Figure 3, but apply average and\\nmax-pooling to each of the four convolutional layer outputs\\nbefore concatenation. Table 6 shows that the CBAM style\\nmodule is considerably worse than ours on all benchmarks\\nexcept Paris6k, where it is only slightly better.\\nConcatenation vs. sum for feature fusion\\nWe use a\\nsoftmax-based weighted average of local and global atten-\\ntion feature maps with the original feature map (7). Here,\\nwe compare this weighted average with weighted concate-\\nnation, where concatenation replaces the sum operation\\nin (7). As shown in Table 7, the weighted average outper-\\nforms the weighted concatenation.\\nFixed-size vs. group-size sampling\\nNumerous studies\\nhave proposed methods for constructing batches according\\nto image size for efﬁcient training. For instance, Gordo et\\nal. [16], DELF [29], and Yokoo et al. [56] employed dif-\\nferent image sizes per batch for training instead of a single\\nﬁxed size. We adopt the method of Yokoo et al., which con-\\nstructs a batch with images of similar aspect ratio, so that\\nthe images can be resized to a size with an aspect ratio that\\nis similar to their own. We call this method group-size sam-\\npling. Table 8 compares ﬁxed-size (224 × 224) with group-\\nsize sampling. We observe that maintaining aspect ratios by\\nusing dynamic input sizes is much more effective.\\nMulti-resolution\\nWe use the multi-resolution representa-\\ntion [16] for the ﬁnal feature of an image at inference time.\\nThis method: (1) resizes an image into multiple scales; (2)\\nextracts features from the resized images; and (3) averages\\nthe features to obtain the ﬁnal feature of the image. The\\nmethod is applied to both query and database images to en-\\nhance ranking results, especially for small target objects.\\nTable 9 compares the four cases of applying this method or\\nnot to query or database images.\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe have introduced a novel approach that extracts global\\nand local contextual information using attention mecha-\\nnisms for instance-level image retrieval. It is manifested as\\na network architecture consisting of global and local atten-\\ntion components, each operating on both spatial and chan-\\nnel dimensions. This constitutes a comprehensive study and\\nempirical evaluation of all four forms of attention that have\\npreviously been studied only in isolation. Our ﬁndings indi-\\ncate that the gain (or loss) brought by one form of attention\\nalone strongly depends on the presence of the others, with\\nthe maximum gain appearing when all forms are present.\\nThe output is a modiﬁed feature tensor that can be used in\\nany way, for instance with local feature detection instead of\\nspatial pooling for image retrieval.\\nWith the advent of vision transformers [12, 58] and their\\nrecent application to image retrieval [13], attention is ex-\\npected to play a more and more signiﬁcant role in vi-\\nsion. According to our classiﬁcation, transformers perform\\nglobal spatial attention alone. It is of great interest to in-\\nvestigate the role of the other forms of attention, where our\\n8\\napproach may yield a basic building block of such archi-\\ntectures. One may even envision an extension to language\\nmodels, where transformers originate from [50].\\nReferences\\n[1] Relja Arandjelovi´c, Petr Gronat, Akihiko Torii, Tomas Pa-\\njdla, and Josef Sivic.\\nNetVLAD: CNN architecture for\\nweakly supervised place recognition.

Many data driven applications involve processing\\nmassive timeseries data, including IoT [11], medical AI [14], stock\\nmarket [27], and so on. As such, there is a great need for timeseries\\nanalytics, such as forecasting [8], classification [20], clustering [31],\\nsimilarity search [39], and anomaly detection [50], with applications\\nranging from automatically diagnosing diseases [5], recognizing\\nhuman activities [29], to stopping financial fraud [59].\\nEffective feature extraction [40] lies at the core of almost all\\nthese timeseries analytics tasks. Recently researchers [61] have\\nstarted leveraging the self-supervised pre-training methodology of\\nTransformers [4, 16, 52], which have proven remarkably successful\\nin natural language processing (NLP), to automatically learn high\\nquality feature embeddings from timeseries. In NLP, self-supervised\\npre-training exploits the sequential patterns (correlations) among\\nthe words in sentences to produce contextualized feature embed-\\ndings. Timeseries bear similarity to natural language, because in\\ntimeseries data the sequential order among the values (stock price,\\nvolume, etc.) over time matters. That is, each value is highly cor-\\nrelated with other values observed before or after it. Therefore,\\n∗Corresponding Author\\npre-training a Transformer model which takes the correlations\\namong different observations into account is a natural idea to learn\\nfeature embeddings from timeseries. Indeed, the experiments in [61]\\nconfirm that Transformer-based methods outperform traditional\\ntimeseries analytics techniques.\\nHowever, existing work [61] that directly applies Transformers\\nto learn features from timeseries data have been shown not to be\\nscalable to long timeseries [30]. The idea of self-attention [52] is\\ncentral to pre-training methods in NLP: It computes pairwise cor-\\nrelations among different semantic units in a sequence (in NLP, a\\nsentence); as such, it has quadratic time and space complexity in\\nthe length of the input sequence. Such an approach places limits on\\nthe model’s scalability, especially when handling large sequences,\\nwhich are common in real-world timeseries applications such as\\nIoT, medical AI, and finance [6, 34, 62]. Predictions about timeseries\\nmay need to look at months or years of historical data to make ac-\\ncurate predictions, spanning hundreds of thousands of samples. As\\nan example, in collaboration with a research hospital we have been\\ndeveloping a seizure classifier that automatically detects seizures\\nbased on EEG signals (timeseries) collected during the clinical ob-\\nservation of patients. As seizures last only a few seconds, we chunk\\nlong EEG data into many 2 second segments and detect seizures at\\na segment level. However, the classification of a particular segment\\ndepends on up to 12 hours of prior signal to determine if one 2\\nsecond segment indicates seizure or not, because seizure diagnosis\\nneeds to consider long-term trends in the EEG data [6]. The number\\nof segments in 12 hours is more than 21k. This is far larger than\\nthe number of semantic units the typical NLP tasks expect. For\\nexample, BERT [16] limits the number of units to 512 and even\\nmassive models like GPT-3 [4] limit the number of units to 2048.\\nAlthough in NLP some lower-complexity methods have been\\nproposed to approximately compute self-attention [10, 26, 54], their\\nperformance degrades dramatically when used on timeseries, due\\nto the gap between natural language and timeseries, as we will\\nshow in our experiments.\\nProposed Approach. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we\\ndevelop RITA, a Transformer-based timeseries analytics tool, which\\nuses a novel attention mechanism, called group attention, to scale\\nto long timeseries.\\nLeveraging the periodicity of timeseries, RITA chunks the input\\ntimeseries into segments and dynamically clusters the segments\\ninto a small number (denoted as 𝑁) of groups. Segments in the\\nsame group possess similar feature embeddings during the current\\ntraining iteration, thus enabling them to approximately share the\\n1\\narXiv:2306.01926v1  [cs.LG]  2 Jun 2023\\ncomputation of attention. As the timeseries increases in length,\\nmore sharing opportunities become available. RITA then computes\\nthe self-attention at a group level and produces a compressed group\\nattention matrix. In this way, group attention eliminates both com-\\nputation and memory bottlenecks in Transformer-style models and\\nthus more scalable to long timeseries.\\nHowever, making this idea effective and efficient in Transformer\\narchitectures is challenging for several reasons:\\n• Efficiently Producing High Quality Feature Embeddings.\\nAlthough RITA computes the attention matrix at a group level, to\\npreserve the quality of the feature embeddings, it still has to pro-\\nduce different embeddings for different segments. This is because\\neven if some segments share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding. However,\\nusing the group attention matrix, the existing self-attention mech-\\nanism will only produce a single feature vector for each group. A\\nnaive solution would be to restore the original attention matrix\\nfrom the group attention matrix. However, in this case we again\\nget an attention matrix with quadratic space complexity. Because\\nGPUs have limited memory, GPU memory will remain a bottleneck\\nin group attention.\\n• The Number of Groups N. In RITA, the number of groups\\n𝑁is a crucial factor that balances the speed up and the quality of\\nattention approximation. A small 𝑁will lead to a large speedup,\\nbut the approximation errors can also be significant. On the other\\nhand, although a large 𝑁tends to produce high-quality approxima-\\ntions, it inevitably slows down the training process. Therefore, an\\nappropriate 𝑁is essential to the performance of group attention.\\nHowever, 𝑁depends on the distributional properties of the dataset.\\nFurthermore, like the classical transformer models, RITA stacks\\nmultiple attention layers to produce better embeddings. Ideally,\\ndifferent layers should also use different values of 𝑁. In addition,\\nduring the model training phrase, group attention should use dif-\\nferent values of 𝑁at different iterations to adapt to the varying\\nfeature embeddings. This makes manually setting appropriate 𝑁\\nalmost impossible.\\n• Batch Size. Moreover, as we want to dynamically adjust 𝑁\\nduring training, a fixed batch size is sub-optimal: as 𝑁decreases,\\nthe memory usage of a single sample decreases. This allows a larger\\nbatch size which is beneficial, because: (1) it makes full use of GPU\\nmemory; (2) high-parallelism across the samples in a big batch\\nbrings better performance. Our experimental study shows that\\ndoubling the batch size reduces the training time by 30%, while still\\npreserving the quality of the model. Thus, RITA should dynamically\\nadjust batch size as 𝑁changes.\\nTo address the above problems, we first propose an embedding\\naggregation strategy and a customized group softmax function to\\nreplace the classical softmax function [52]. Together they ensure\\nRITA is able to directly use the compressed attention matrix to\\nproduce different feature embeddings for different segments. We\\ntheoretically show the embeddings RITA produces in this way are\\nidentical to those produced by first re-storing the original large\\nattention matrix. Thus RITA is able to produce high quality embed-\\ndings without introducing extra overhead. Further, we design a GPU\\nfriendly algorithm to group the segments in parallel, effectively\\nminimizing the grouping cost.\\nP0\\nPosition\\nEmbedding\\nW1\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nWindow \\nEmbedding\\n+\\nE0\\nRaw\\nTimeseries\\nTime-aware \\nConvolution\\nW[CLS]\\nW2\\n⊗\\n.....\\nWn\\nP1\\nP2\\n.....\\nPn\\n.....\\nE1\\nE2\\nEn\\n.....\\nO0\\nO1\\nO2\\nOn\\n.....\\nRITA Encoder\\nScale & Input\\nFigure 1: RITA Architecture\\nSecond, we design an adaptive scheduler which dynamically de-\\ncides an appropriate 𝑁for each group attention layer during the\\ntraining process. It starts with a large 𝑁and iteratively merges\\ngroups that are similar to each other. Guided by an error bound on\\nthe approximated self-attention that users can tolerate, it automati-\\ncally determines if two groups are mergeable, performing merging\\nefficiently in a GPU-friendly way.\\nMoreover, we propose a learning-based method to model the\\ncorrelation between the number of groups 𝑁and the batch size 𝐵.\\nThis model is used to predict 𝐵for a given 𝑁when training RITA.\\nSpecifically, we first sample some 𝑁values in a reasonable range.\\nFor each sampled 𝑁, we find a batch size that consumes up to a\\ncertain percentage of GPU memory in a cost-efficient way. Using a\\nsmall set of mathematical functions as a prior, RITA learns a model\\nwith only a few <N, B> pairs as ground truth labels.\\nOur experiments on public timeseries benchmarks and the MGH\\nEEG data [6] confirm that RITA outperforms state-of-the-art meth-\\nods in accuracy on various timeseries analytics tasks, while our\\ngroup attention mechanism achieves a 63X speedup with much\\nless memory required, compared to existing self-attention mecha-\\nnisms [10, 52, 54].\\nContributions. The key contributions of this work include:\\n• Our group attention mechanism leverages the periodicity of\\ntimeseries, reducing the time and space complexity of the self-\\nattention mechanism with accuracy guarantees, allowing RITA to\\nscale to long timeseries data.\\n• Guided by an approximation error bound, our adaptive sched-\\nuler dynamically adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nto the distribution properties of the evolving feature embeddings,\\nmaking group attention efficient and easily tunable.\\n• We conduct experiments on various datasets and different ana-\\nlytics tasks, demonstrating that RITA is 4 to 63 times faster than\\nthe state-of-the-art while achieving better accuracy when handling\\nlong timeseries (length ≥2000).\\n2\\n2\\nBACKGROUND\\nWe provide some background on the canonical self-attention mod-\\nule in the Transformer[52]. A self-attention module takes 𝑛hidden\\nembedding vectors 𝐻∈R𝑛∗𝑑ℎas input, then projects them to\\nqueries (𝑄), keys (𝐾) and values (𝑉) and performs Scaled-dot Prod-\\nuct Attention, which given input hidden state 𝐻, is computed by:\\n𝑄= 𝐻𝑊𝑄, 𝐾= 𝐻𝑊𝐾,𝑉= 𝐻𝑊𝑉\\n𝑂= 𝐴𝑉= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥( 𝑄𝐾𝑇\\n√︁\\n𝑑𝑘\\n)𝑉\\n(1)\\nWhere 𝑊𝑄∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝐾∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑉∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑣are projection\\nmatrices for generating 𝑄, 𝐾,𝑉. 𝑄∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘is also regarded as the\\npacking of 𝑛query vectors {𝑞1, ...,𝑞𝑛} with dimension 𝑑𝑘into a\\nmatrix. 𝐾∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘,𝑉∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑣are regarded as the packing of key\\nvectors {𝑘1, ...,𝑘𝑛} and value vectors {𝑣1, ..., 𝑣𝑛} in the same way.\\nGiven a matrix 𝑀∈R𝐿∗𝑛, the softmax function normalizes 𝑀\\nto ensure the sum of each row equals to 1, as shown below.\\n𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑀𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑛−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑘)\\n(2)\\nNote the attention matrix A is an 𝑛×𝑛matrix, where 𝑛represents\\nthe number of elements in the input sequence (e.g. words in NLP).\\n3\\nRITA OVERVIEW\\nGiven a collection of unlabeled timeseries, RITA first pre-trains\\na Transformer-style model to produce high quality feature em-\\nbeddings for timeseries data. This pre-trained model is then used\\nto support various downstream tasks, similar to BERT [16]. Next,\\nwe overview the model architecture of RITA. We show how RITA\\nsupports various downstream tasks in Appendix A.7.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, RITA is consist of two components: (1) Time-\\naware Convolution Layer (2) RITA Encoder.\\nTime-aware Convolution Layer fills the gap between timeseries\\nand natural language. Despite their high-level similarity, there is a\\nbig gap between timeseries and natural language. First, in natural\\nlanguage each word, as a discrete semantic unit, has an indepen-\\ndent meaning, while each element in a timeseries is a continuous,\\nnumerical value and does not necessarily constitute an independent\\nevent. Furthermore, the input sequences are single-channeled in\\nNLP, but often multi-channeled in timeseries (i.e., sensor data often\\nconsists of several related channels).\\nRITA leverages the classical convolution [28] strategy to solve\\nthis problem. Convolution is widely used to capture the local struc-\\ntures of an image. We use convolution to chunk one input timeseries\\ninto a sequence of windows and learn the local structure of each\\nwindow, similar to the discrete semantic units in natural language.\\nIt also discovers the correlations across different channels, thus\\nnaturally solving the multi-channel problem.\\nMore specifically, treating a multi-variate timeseries of length 𝑛\\nand with𝑚variables as an n × m matrix𝑇, RITA uses𝑑convolution\\nkernels to chunk𝑇into n windows and produce one d-dimensional\\nembedding per window using the convolution operation [28]. Each\\nconvolution kernel corresponds to a w × m matrix, where 𝑤defines\\nthe number of timestamps that each convolution kernel covers,\\nidentical to the window size in sliding window.\\nRITA Encoder functions as Transformer Encoder as described in\\nthe original Transformer work[52]. It takes the embeddings of 𝑛\\nsemantic units 𝑋1,𝑋2, ...,𝑋𝑛(𝑋𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as input (e.g. embeddings of\\n𝑛windows for a timeseries), then models the correlations between\\nthe semantic units and outputs 𝑌1, ...,𝑌𝑛(𝑌𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as the context-\\naware embedding of each unit.\\nWhat makes RITA Encoder different from Transformer Encoder\\nis that: at the core of Transformer Encoder lies self-attention mech-\\nanism which incurs a 𝑂(𝑛2) time complexity and memory usage.\\nThis quadratic cost becomes prohibitive for long timeseries and\\nlimits the scalablity of Transformer-based models. To make the\\nattention computation efficient yet high-quality, we replace the\\ncanonical self-attention with our proposed group attention.\\nSelf-supervised Pretraining. Inspired by the “cloze text” pre-\\ntraining task in NLP, we designed a mask-and-predict task as the\\npretraining task for our model. The timeseries is randomly masked\\nand the model should recover the masked values based on corre-\\nsponding contextual information.\\nTo be specific, we generate masks on time-stamps, with a mask\\nrate 𝑝. The timeseries is scaled to be non-negative and the values\\nacross all the channels on the masked timestamps are set to be -1,\\nan impossible value on normal timestamps. Then the masked time-\\nseries is fed into RITA and the output representation is translated\\nto the recovered timeseries by a Transpose Convolution layer.\\n4\\nGROUP ATTENTION MECHANISM\\nGroup attention, a novel and efficient approximate attention mecha-\\nnism, addresses the performance bottleneck of self-attention in the\\nvanilla Transformer. In this section, we first introduce the frame-\\nwork of group attention and then theoretically establish the bound\\nof its approximation error.\\n4.1\\nThe Idea of Group Attention\\nAs periodicity is a natural property of timeseries [56], similar\\nwindows frequently occur. Similar windows result in similar\\nqueries/keys for attention computation, bringing opportunities for\\nsaving computation.\\nAs discussed in Sec. 2, 𝐴𝑖𝑗, the attention score of window 𝑖onto\\nwindow 𝑗, is determined by the inner product between the query\\nvector of window 𝑖and the key vector of window 𝑗, that is, 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗.\\nGiven another window 𝑥, if window 𝑥has the similar key vector\\nto window 𝑗, that is, 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥, then 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗≈𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑥. In other words,\\n𝐴𝑖𝑗≈𝐴𝑖𝑥when 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥.\\nThis observation inspires our group attention mechanism. That\\nis, we group the windows by their similarity in keys. Assuming\\nall windows in the same group have the same attention score onto\\nanother window 𝑘, we then only compute the attention once by\\nusing one single key to represent this group, for example the centroid\\nof the group of keys. This thus saves significant computation cost.\\nBetter yet, after grouping 𝑛windows into 𝑁groups, group atten-\\ntion compresses the attention matrix from an𝑛×𝑛matrix to an𝑛×𝑁\\nmatrix. Because 𝑁(number of groups) tends to be much smaller\\nthan 𝑛(number of windows) due to the periodicity of timeseries,\\ngroup attention consumes much less memory than the original\\nself-attention mechanism, successfully eliminating the memory\\nbottleneck. Note that it also doesn’t hurt quality all that much, as\\nconfirmed in our experiments (Sec. 6.2).\\n3\\nGrouping\\nAverage\\nK\\nQ\\nMatMul\\nAttention Matrix\\nWeighted\\nSoftMax\\nV\\nSum\\nAggregate\\nTranspose\\nMatMul\\nOutput\\nQ \\nK \\nV\\nFigure 2: Group Attention\\n4.2\\nComputing the Output Feature Embedding\\nWe now discuss how to efficiently compute the output feature\\nembeddings using the small compressed group attention matrix.\\n4.2.1\\nProblem: Producing Embeddings w/ Group Attention Matrix\\nAs described in the Background, once we have acquired the at-\\ntention matrix 𝐴, canonical self-attention computes the output\\nembedding 𝑂as O = AV. Because 𝐴is an 𝑛× 𝑛matrix and 𝑉is an\\n𝑛×𝑑𝑣matrix, the matrix product operation still produces an 𝑛×𝑑𝑣\\nmatrix 𝑂. That is, it produces a 𝑑𝑣dimensional feature vector for\\neach window. However, our group attention will produce an 𝑛× 𝑁\\nattention matrix e\\n𝐴, where 𝑁corresponds to the number of groups.\\nIn this case the matrix product will produce a 𝑁×𝑑𝑣matrix e\\n𝑂. That\\nis, it produces a feature vector for each group. However, our goal\\nis to produce different embeddings for different windows, because\\neven if some windows share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding.\\nA Naive Solution. A naive solution would be to restore the full\\nattention matrix 𝐴from the group attention matrix e\\n𝐴. For example,\\ngiven one group composed of 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗, we map its group\\nattention vector in e\\n𝐴into two rows that correspond to 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗in 𝐴. However, in this case we again get a 𝑛× 𝑛attention\\nmatrix; and GPU memory remains a bottleneck in group attention.\\n4.2.2\\nSolution: Embedding Aggregation and Group SoftMax\\nUsing an embedding aggregation operation and a group softmax\\nfunction, RITA produces 𝑛embeddings without restoring the full\\nattention matrix. Fig. 2 shows the workflow of group attention.\\nEmbedding Aggregation. The idea is inspired by the observation\\non the matrix product operation O = AV conducted on the fully\\nrestored attention matrix 𝐴.\\nGiven an element𝑂𝑖,𝑗of𝑂corresponding to the 𝑗𝑡ℎdimension of\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖’s feature vector,𝑂𝑖,𝑗= 𝑎𝑖·𝑣𝑗, where vector ai ∈Rn denotes the\\n𝑖𝑡ℎrow of the attention matrix 𝐴and vector vj ∈Rn denotes the 𝑗𝑡ℎ\\ndimension of all the 𝑛feature vectors. Given ai =< a1\\ni , a2\\ni , · · · , an\\ni >\\nand vj =< v1\\nj , v2\\nj , · · · , vn\\nj >, 𝑂𝑖,𝑗= Ín\\nk=1 ak\\ni vk\\nj .\\nAs an example, assume 𝑤𝑖𝑛1 and 𝑤𝑖𝑛2 belong to the same group\\n𝐺1. Then 𝑎1\\n𝑖= 𝑎2\\n𝑖= e𝑎1\\n𝑖, where e𝑎1\\n𝑖∈e\\n𝐴corresponds to the attention\\nof group 𝐺1 onto 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖. Therefore, 𝑎1\\n𝑖𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑎2\\n𝑖𝑣2\\n𝑗= e𝑎1\\n𝑖(𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑣2\\n𝑗).\\nAs an immediate generalization of the above analysis, if we ag-\\ngregate up the windows that belong to the same group and convert\\nthe n-dimensional feature vector 𝑣𝑗into a 𝑁-dimensional group fea-\\nture vectore𝑣𝑗beforehand, we could directly use the group attention\\nvector e𝑎𝑖and the group feature vector e𝑣𝑗to compute 𝑂𝑖,𝑗.\\nUsing embedding aggregation, RITA is able to produce the fea-\\nture embedding e\\n𝑂that is identical to the embedding 𝑂produced\\nby using the full attention matrix 𝐴and the embedding matrix 𝑉.\\nGroup Softmax Function. In canonical self-attention the atten-\\ntion matrix 𝐴is computed as 𝐴= SoftMax( QKT\\n√\\ndk ). To compute 𝐴,\\nwe have to first compute 𝑄𝐾𝑇(denoted as 𝑃) which is an 𝑛× 𝑛\\nmatrix. Then normalizing the 𝑃matrix with softmax produces the\\nattention matrix 𝐴.\\nGroup attention follows the same procedure. But after grouping\\nkeys into e𝐾, 𝑄e𝐾𝑇produces an 𝑛× 𝑁matrix e𝑃. Due to the non-\\nlinearity of the softmax function, applying softmax directly on e𝑃\\nwill result in a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴from which we are not able\\nto recover a full attention matrix that is identical to first restoring\\ne𝑃to 𝑃and then applying softmax on 𝑃. The 𝐴matrix produced\\nby the latter is desirable, as we want to approximate the original\\nattention matrix as accurately as possible. However, restoring the\\nsmall 𝑛× 𝑁e𝑃matrix is not memory efficient, as it will end up with\\na full 𝑛× 𝑛matrix 𝑃.\\nTo solve the above problems, we introduce a new group softmax\\nfunction to replace the original softmax function (Eq. 2).\\n𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(g\\n𝑃𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑘)\\n(3)\\nIn Eq. 3, 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘represents the number of windows that Group\\n𝐺𝑘contains. Compared to the original softmax, our group softmax\\nconsiders each group 𝐺𝑘as 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘elements and counts it 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘\\ntimes when summing up the exponential of each group’s 𝑃𝑖,𝑘. In\\nthis way, the group softmax function operating on the small e𝑃\\nmatrix will produce exactly the same result to the softmax function\\noperating on the full 𝑃matrix.\\nTheoretical Guarantee. In Appendix A.4, we prove that the group\\nsoftmax function and the embedding aggregation operation produce\\nthe same output feature embedding with the naive method that has\\nto first restore the big full attention matrix.\\nWe show an efficient implementation of the embedding aggrega-\\ntion operation and group softmax function in Appendix A.2, Alg. 1.\\nTime Complexity. The time complexity of Alg. 1 is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁𝑑) and\\nthe space complexity is𝑂(𝑛𝑁), while the time and space complexity\\nof the original self-attention mechanism are 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑) and 𝑂(𝑛2).\\n4.3\\nError Bound\\nGroup attention produces a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴which approxi-\\nmates the attention matrix𝐴produced by the classical self-attention\\nwith a bounded error, as shown in Lemma 1.\\nLemma 1. Let 𝑅be the radius of the ball where all key vectors\\nlive; e𝑘𝑖be the representative of the group that contains key 𝑘𝑖. Let 𝐴\\ndenote the full attention matrix restored from e\\n𝐴. Suppose the distance\\nbetween e𝑘𝑖and 𝑘𝑖(||ek𝑖−k𝑖||) satisfies: ||ek𝑖−k𝑖|| ≤d.\\nThen ∀𝜖> 1, if d ≤ln(𝜖)\\n2R , 1\\n𝜖≤Ai,j\\nAi,j ≤𝜖\\nLemma 1 shows that the error bound 𝜖of the group attention is\\ndetermined by the distance 𝑑. As discussed in Sec. 5.1, it inspires\\nus to design a strategy to dynamically determine the number of\\ngroups 𝑁– the most critical parameter of group attention. Please\\nrefer to Appendix A.5 for the proof.\\n4\\n4.4\\nGPU Friendly Grouping Method\\nIn this section, we discuss the implementation of a grouping method.\\nTo make group attention efficient and effective, the grouping\\nmethod has to satisfy the following requirements:\\n(1) Tight distance bound: to ensure the approximation quality,\\nthe distance between each key and its group representative should\\nbe minimized according to Lemma 1.\\n(2) Lightweight: to ensure the performance gain, the grouping\\nmethod must be lightweight, at worst not exceeding the complexity\\nof group attention itself (𝑂(𝑁𝑛)).\\n(3) GPU friendly: to take advantage of GPUs, we prefer a group-\\ning method that mainly consists of matrix operations, which can\\nbe efficiently executed on a GPU.\\nTo satisfy the above requirements, after thorough investigation\\non various clustering algorithms, we design a GPU friendly K-\\nmeans [35] as the grouping method.\\nFirst, K-means minimizes the overall distance between any object\\nand its cluster center, hence naturally satisfying Requirement 1.\\nSecond, given 𝑁centers, in each iteration the time and space\\ncomplexity of K-means is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁). Usually, the iteration goes until\\nconvergence. However, we observe that rather than seeking a per-\\nfect K-means clustering, training a few iterations is sufficient to\\nget a good grouping for group attention, because typically the later\\niterations only slightly update the clustering and group attention\\nis robust to such imperfection.\\nThird, we design a GPU-friendly implementation of K-means.\\nThe performance bottleneck of K-means comes from the dis-\\ntance computation between each vector and its center, that is,\\n|vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n(vi −cj)2, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. The performance bot-\\ntleneck is 𝑣𝑖−𝑐𝑗. We instead use a different formulation: |𝑣𝑖−\\n𝑐𝑗| = |vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n|vi|2 + |cj|2 −2vi · cj, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. This is\\nbecause in this formulation, the performance bottleneck is 𝑣𝑖· 𝑐𝑗,\\nwhich could be implemented as a matrix product operation. Al-\\nthough the complexity of the two formulations is the same, in GPUs\\nmatrix product is much more efficient than pairwise difference.\\n5\\nADAPTIVE SCHEDULER\\nNext, we present the adaptive scheduler of RITA which addresses\\nthe challenges of determining an appropriate number of groups\\n𝑁and accordingly the batch size 𝐵, as described in Introduction.\\nUsing a dynamic scheduling method we propose, the scheduler\\nautomatically determines and adjusts 𝑁and 𝐵based on the distri-\\nbutional properties of the feature embeddings produced over the\\niterative training process, while guaranteed to produce high quality\\nattention approximation that meets the requirement of users.\\nIn Sec. 5.1 we show how RITA automatically determines 𝑁. Then\\nwe introduce in Sec. 5.2 the learning-based method which given an\\n𝑁, immediately predicts a good batch size.\\n5.1\\nDynamically Determining the Number of\\nGroups N\\nWithout loss of generality, we use one group attention module as\\nan example to show how RITA automatically gets an appropriate 𝑁.\\nThe adaptive scheduler of RITA starts with a large 𝑁and decreases\\nit dynamically. This is because in the training process of RITA, the\\nfeature embeddings produced epoch by epoch tend to get stabler\\nand stabler and gradually converge, thus no need to increase 𝑁.\\nRITA reduces the number of groups by merging similar groups.\\nIntuitively, given two groups, we could measure their similarity\\nbased on the distance of their centers. If the distance between\\ntheir centers is smaller than a distance threshold, then the two\\ngroups could be merged. However, setting an appropriate distance\\nthreshold seems hard – as difficult as setting an appropriate 𝑁.\\nTo solve this problem, RITA leverages the error bound of group\\nattention introduced in Sec. 4.3. It only requires users to set an\\nerror bound 𝜖, and then uses Lemma 1 to translate 𝜖to a distance\\nthreshold 𝑑. RITA then uses Lemma 2 to determine if merging some\\ngiven clusters still meets the error bound threshold 𝜖.\\nLemma 2. Denote 𝑐𝑘to be the cluster center of 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘. Assume\\nthe existing grouping satisfies ∀k,\\nmax\\nx∈clusterk\\n|ck −x| ≤d , thus satis-\\nfying an error bound 𝜖by Lemma 1. If there exist 𝑚clusters, namely,\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘2, ...,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑚, satisfying that:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑐𝑘𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑘𝑖| ≤𝑑,𝑖, 𝑗∈[1,𝑚]\\n(4)\\nmerging them into one cluster still meets the error bound 𝜖.\\nPlease refer to Appendix A.6 for the proof.\\nFinding the Mergable Clusters. We formulate the problem of\\nfinding mergeable clusters using graph theory:\\n(1) each cluster is a node in the graph;\\n(2) if 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑, and\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\nthere is an undirected edge between 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑖and 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗;\\nIn this scenario, finding the maximum number of mergeable\\nclusters is equivalent to finding the minimal clique cover in the\\ncorresponding graph, which is an NP-hard problem [24]. Such\\nheavy computation overhead is not acceptable for RITA. We thus\\noffer a simplified solution:\\n(1) Halve the clusters into two sets 𝑆1,𝑆2;\\n(2) If 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1 and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗∈𝑆2 satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\n2\\n(5)\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗is marked.\\n(3) Decrease the number of clusters by counting the masks in 𝑆2.\\nIn this solution, clusters in 𝑆1 can be regarded as transfer nodes.\\nIf (5) holds for (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1 ∈𝑆2) and (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈\\n𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗2 ∈𝑆2), respectively, we have,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗2 | ≤𝑑\\n(6)\\nThus (4) holds when merging several clusters in 𝑆2 with one\\ncluster in 𝑆1. As a result, we can greedily merge clusters in 𝑆2, as\\nillustrated in step(3).\\nAssume the number of clusters decreases by 𝐷after merging,\\nwe apply a momentum update [42] on the number of clusters 𝑁, as\\nis commonly used in machine learning to smooth the changing of\\n𝑁and avoid sample selection bias. To be specific: 𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑤= 𝛼(𝑁−\\n𝐷) + (1 −𝛼)𝑁, where 𝛼is a hyper-parameter for momentum.\\n5\\n5.2\\nDynamically Determining the Batch Size\\nBecause of the dynamic grouping operation, the computational\\ngraph in deep learning training [1] varies from sample to sample. As\\na result, it is impossible to precisely compute a batch’s GPU memory\\nusage without indeed feeding it into the model. To overcome this\\nproblem, RITA learns a batch size prediction function offline; then\\nat the RITA training time, given a number of groups 𝑁, RITA uses\\nthis function to predict a proper batch size.\\nWhen the model architecture and hardware are fixed, the batch\\nsize depends on the length of the timeseries 𝐿and the average\\ngroup number among all attention module 𝑁. So RITA samples\\nseveral (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs and estimate a proper batch size for each pair.\\nMore specifically, given a user-defined timeseries maximal length\\n𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, we randomly sample integral points (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) from plane\\n{1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}. Then we use a binary search based\\nalgorithm to find the maximal batch size 𝐵𝑖that consumes less than\\n90% available GPU memory, aiming to avoid wasting GPU memory\\nand the risks of out of memory (OOM).\\nTreating these pairs as ground truth labels, we use function\\nfitting [18] to learn the batch size predicting function B = f (L, N),\\nwhere B is a function of two variables 𝐿and 𝑁.\\nLearning the Prediction Function. We apply curve fit from\\nSciPy [53] as the function fitting tool to fit the two-variable function\\n𝐵𝑖= 𝑓(𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) on plane {1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}.\\nWe observe that applying one function to the whole plane incurs\\na huge estimation error. So we develop a dynamic-programming\\n(DP) method to divide the plane into several sub-planes and apply\\na distinct function to each sub-plane respectively. It is optimal in\\nminimizing the total estimation error on all sub-planes\\nWith the learned prediction function 𝑓, we can estimate a proper\\nbatch size for any (𝐿, 𝑁) during training, even if it is not seen in\\nthe sampled (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs.\\nThe Algorithms and Optimality Proof. Please refer to Appen-\\ndix A.3 for the pseudo code of the binary search-based algorithm\\nand the description of the DP method for plane-division and the\\nproof for its optimality.\\n6\\nEVALUATION\\nOur experimental study focuses on the following questions:\\n1. Effectiveness and efficiency of RITA: How does RITA com-\\npare with other Transformer-based methods and traditional time-\\nseries representation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency?\\n2. Ablation Study: How do the key techniques of RITA work?\\n6.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nDatasets. We evaluate RITA on classification and imputation tasks\\nusing 5 multi-variate and 3 uni-variate timeseries datasets.\\n• WISDM [55] is a popular multivariate timeseries dataset gen-\\nerated from the accelerometer in the mobile phone. The subjects\\nperformed 18 daily activities (e.g. walking, jogging). The dataset\\nwas collected from 51 subjects and the sampling rate is 20 Hz.\\n• HHAR dataset [46] contains sensing data of accelerometer col-\\nlected from 9 users performing 5 activities with 12 different smart-\\nphones (varying in sampling rate). This increases the complexity\\nof the task and thus can test the model’s robustness.\\n• RWHAR RealWorld HAR dataset [48] covers 15 subjects per-\\nforming 8 locomotion-style activities. Each subject wears the sen-\\nsors for approximately ten minutes. The sampling rate is 50 Hz.\\n• ECG dataset [34] consists of 10,000 EEG recordings for arrhyth-\\nmia classification. Each recording has an uncertain length ranging\\nfrom 6 to 60 seconds sampled at 500 Hz. The ECG recordings corre-\\nspond to 9 types of heart problems such as atrial fibrillation (AF)\\nand premature atrial contraction (PAC), etc.\\n• MGH [6] is a EEG dataset collected by Mass. General Hospital.\\nEach timeseries corresponds to the EEG data observed from one\\npatient during their stay in ICU for a couple of days. The EEG\\nmonitoring produced data with 20 channels. The sampling rate is\\n200 HZ. So it produces very long timeseries.\\n• WISDM*/HHAR*/RWHAR* are three uni-variate datasets de-\\nrived by picking one channel from WISDM/HHAR/RWHAR.\\nTraining/Validation Data Generation. We apply a sliding win-\\ndow on the raw timeseries to get training/validation samples. The\\nsize of the sliding window is set as 200 on small datasets (WISDM,\\nHHAR, RWHAR), 2000 on medium size dataset (ECG), and 10,000\\non the large dataset (MGH). Table 1 shows the statics of the gen-\\nerated datasets. They are randomly split into training/validation\\nset in a proportion of 0.9/0.1. In “pretraining + few-label finetun-\\ning” scenario, we use 100 labeled data per class for finetuning. We\\nguarantee that training set does not overlap with the validation set.\\nDataset\\nTrain.

We compare RITA against the SOTA Trans-\\nformer based timeseries representation learning method TST [61].\\nTo evaluate our group attention (referred to as Group Attn.), we\\ndevelop three baselines by replacing the group attention compo-\\nnent in RITA with the classic vanilla Self-Attention [52](referred\\nto as Vanilla) and two SOTA methods that reduce the complexity\\nof self-attention by approximation in NLP, namely, Performer [10]\\n(referred to as Performer) and Linformer [54] (referred to as Lin-\\nformer). Similar to our proposed Group Attn., Vanilla, Performer,\\nLinformer all use RITA’s time-aware convolution operation (Sec. 3)\\nto turn timeseries segments into input feature vectors.\\nWe also compare Group Attn. against GRAIL [40], which is\\nthe SOTA of the non-deep learning methods for timeseries repre-\\nsentation learning. GRAIL supports classification tasks by feeding\\nthe learned representations into a Support-Vector Machine [12]\\nor K-Nearest Neighbor [17] classifier. Note GRAIL only targets\\nuni-variate timeseries and cannot support imputation tasks.\\nMethodology. We mainly focus on two downstream tasks:\\n(1) Classification. First, we train Group Attn. and the base-\\nlines with full labels from scratch to test the effectiveness of RITA\\nframework and the approximation quality of our group attention.\\nSecond, to measure the effectiveness of self-supervised pretrain-\\ning, we evaluate the accuracy of training on few labeled timeseries\\nwith/without pretraining on large scales of unlabeled timeseries. To\\nbe specific, we split the training set into a pretraining set and a fine-\\ntuning set, with very few data in the latter (100 labeled samples per\\n6\\n(a) Effectiveness \\n(b) Efficiency\\nTraining Time/sec\\nFigure 3: Full-label classification results (multi-variate data).\\nclass in our experiment). We train the model on the cloze pretrain-\\ning task with a mask rate 𝑝= 0.2. Then we train two classification\\nmodels using the finetuning set, either based on the pretrained\\nversion or from scratch. We repeat the experiment 5 times with\\nrandom data splits and report the median accuracy.\\n(2) Imputation. We run the imputation task on the datasets used\\nin classification as well as the large unlabeled MGH dataset, and\\nmeasure the mean square error and absolute imputation error. To\\nget timeseries with missing values, we randomly mask the values\\nwith an expected mask rate of 𝑝= 0.2. The masked values are\\nreplaced with a special value.\\nFinally, to evaluate Group Attn.’s benefit on efficiency, the total\\ntime of forward computation, backward propagation, and grouping\\nare measured for all methods in all the experiments.\\nTo save space, we only report the average training time per epoch\\nhere and refer readers to Appendix A.8 for the inference time.\\nWe first compare against the Transformer-based methods on\\nmulti-variate datasets (sec. 6.2, 6.3), then compare against the non-\\ndeep learning method GRAIL on uni-variate datasets (sec. 6.4).\\nConfiguration. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for the experiment\\nconfiguration and hyper-parameter settings.\\n6.2\\nEffectiveness: Transformer-Based Methods\\nWe first evaluate the quality of the models trained with full labels\\nfrom scratch. We then show how the pretraining of RITA increases\\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks.\\n6.2.1\\nfull-label training (Multi-variate classification)\\nResults shown in Figure 3(a) get us the following observations:\\n(1) RITA’s advantage over TST. On all four datasets for the clas-\\nsification tasks, Group Attn. and the other three baselines that use\\nRITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and Linformer) outperform\\nTST. In particular, Group Attn. outperforms TST by 49 percentage\\npoints on the ECG dataset (88.48% vs 39.93%) with long timeseries.\\nTwo deficiencies in TST may cause its poor performance on the long\\ntimeseries. Firstly, TST concatenates the output embedding vector\\nof each time stamp, then uses a linear classifier to do classification\\non the concatenated vector. When the timeseries is long, the linear\\nclassifier has so many parameters that it tends to overfit easily.\\nSecondly, TST replaces Layer Normalization in vanilla Transformer\\nwith Batch Normalization. When the timeseries is long, it can only\\naccommodate a small number of timeseries in each batch, leading\\nto bias in Batch Normalization.\\n(2) Group-attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on\\n3 out of 4 datasets for classification. Although Linformer works\\nslightly better than Group Attn. on the ECG dataset (90.37% vs\\n88.84%), its performance is the worst in all other cases compared\\nto any other RITA-based methods. Vanilla computes the attention\\nscores precisely. Thus it is expected to work well. However, Group\\nAttn. outperforms Vanilla on WISDM (87.50% vs 86.95%) and is very\\nclose to it on other 3 datasets. This suggests that group attention’s\\napproximation quality is good.\\n6.2.2\\npretraining + few label finetune (Multi-variate classification)\\nThe results shown in Table 3 get us the following observation:\\n(1) Pretraining is effective. Pretraining always leads to better\\naccuracy than training with a few labels from scratch. In particular,\\non WISDM data all the methods using RITA architecture increase\\nthe accuracy by at least 10%. This is impressive considering we do\\nnot have a very large unlabeled pre-training set to use.\\n(2) RITA’s advantage over TST. our Group Attn. and other\\nthree baselines using RITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and\\nLinformer) significantly outperform TST on all four classification\\ndatasets by 25 percentage points.\\n(3) Group Attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on 3\\nout of 4 datasets. When compared to Vanilla, Group Attn. is better\\non HHAR and ECG, and comparable on the other two, further con-\\nfirming its high quality on approximation. Further, we notice that\\nLinformer struggles in this setting: in average its accuracy is worse\\nthan Vanilla by 8.22% and Group Attn. by 8.01%. This is because the\\nlow-rank projection operation introduces extra model parameters,\\nmaking Linformer more easily overfit, while overfitting is especially\\nharmful when there are only a few labeled training samples.\\n6.2.3\\nfull-dataset training (Multi-variate imputation)\\nSimilar to classification tasks, the results of imputation tasks\\n(Table.2) show that Group Attn. consistently outperforms the base-\\nlines in training time while achieving comparable/better MSE. Again,\\non the large dataset MGH (length = 10,000), TST and Vanilla fail due\\nto out of memory (OOM) errors. Methods using RITA framework\\n(Group Attn., Performer, Linformer) all achieve very low MSE (are\\nhighly accurate). Among them Linformer is the worst.\\n6.3\\nEfficiency: Transformer-based Methods\\nWe measure the efficiency by the average training time per epoch\\nincluding the cost of the forward computation + backward propaga-\\ntion and the grouping overhead. We first show the results on all the\\n5 datasets in Sec. 6.3.1. We then vary the length of the timeseries\\non the MGH dataset to show group attention’s scalability on long\\ntimeseries in Sec. 6.3.2.\\n6.3.1\\nTraining Time: All Multi-variate Datasets\\nThe results in Fig. 3(b) and Table 2 lead to the below observations:\\n(1) Vanilla Self-Attention is not scalable.

Moreover, as the length increases from 2000 to 10000,\\nthe training time of Group Attn. only increases from 31.2 seconds\\nto 54.4 seconds per epoch. The reason is that as the timeseires\\nbecomes longer, there are more grouping opportunities because of\\nthe similarity of the timeseries segments.\\nAccuracy\\nTraining Time/sec\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure 5: Comparison to non-deep learning method (uni-\\nvariate data).\\n6.4\\nComparison to Non-deep Learning Methods\\nWe compare against GRAIL, the SOTA of non-deep learning time-\\nseries representation learning.

We\\nvary 𝑁and the error bound threshold 𝜖used by RITA.\\nFrom the results in Table 4 we get the following observations:\\n(1) Adaptive Scheduler is better than fixed 𝑁. Training with\\nAdaptive Scheduler already achieves better or comparable perfor-\\nmance compared to the best performing 𝑁. More specifically, on\\nthe MGH dataset, dynamic scheduler always achieves better accu-\\nracy and is much faster compared to fixed 𝑁. On the ECG dataset,\\nalthough fixed 𝑁is slightly better than adaptive scheduler in accu-\\nracy when setting the N as 512, it runs much slower than adaptive\\nscheduler. Of course, finding the best 𝑁that balances the accuracy\\nand running time requires careful tuning.\\n(2) Adaptive Scheduler is tuning free. It is robust on both\\naccuracy and running time when 𝜖varies, while the results of\\nfixed 𝑁vary significantly when the value of 𝑁changes. Therefore,\\nAdaptive Scheduler frees the users from tuning the 𝜖threshold,\\nwhile it is hard to find an appropriate 𝑁for a given dataset.\\n8\\nDataset\\nTask\\nScheduler\\nParameter\\nMetric\\nTime\\nECG\\nClass.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n88.34%\\n292.5\\n2\\n88.48%\\n236.8\\n3\\n87.83%\\n216.8\\nFixed\\n64\\n87.50%\\n255.2\\n128\\n88.96%\\n297.2\\n256\\n88.82%\\n414.1\\n512\\n90.03%\\n662.6\\n1024\\n88.65%\\n873.7\\nMGH\\nImput.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n0.00041\\n60.7\\n2\\n0.00040\\n57.9\\n3\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nFixed\\n128\\n0.00054\\n128.6\\n256\\n0.00053\\n190.2\\n512\\n0.00049\\n240.8\\n1024\\n0.00046\\n323.3\\nTable 4: Adaptive Scheduling VS Fixed N.\\nPretrain Data size\\nFew-label Accuracy\\nN/A\\n62.56%\\n12,446\\n72.94%\\n24,892\\n72.78%\\n37,338\\n74.10%\\n49,784\\n74.22%\\n62,231\\n75.06%\\nTable 5: RITA Pretraining: increasing sizes of pretrain set.\\n6.5.2\\nThe Sizes of the Pretraining Data\\nNext, we evaluate how the number of unlabeled data influences the\\neffectiveness of pretraining. To get empirical results, we pretrain\\nRITA on WISDM dataset with 20%/40%/60%/80% of the pretraining\\ndata and finetune each pretrained model with 100 labels per class.\\nThe results in Table 5 show that: (1) The more pretraining data,\\nthe larger the improvement. The accuracy increases with the\\nsizes of the pretraining data; (2) Marginal utility diminishing.\\nThe first 20% pretraining data gives a 10.38% improvement in accu-\\nracy (72.94% vs 62.56%), while the remaining 80% pretraining data\\nonly gives an additional improvement of 2.12% (75.06% vs 72.94%).\\n7\\nRELATED WORK\\n7.1\\nTimeseries Analytics\\nThere is a great deal of prior work on timeseries analytics methods.\\nThis work can be divided into three categories: (1) non-deep learn-\\ning methods; (2) CNN/RNN-based deep learning methods; and (3)\\nTransformer-based deep learning methods.\\nTraditional Methods. These methods, such as TS-CHIEF [45],\\nHIVE-COTE [33], ROCKET [15] have achieved notable performance\\non public datasets. Despite that, traditional methods suffer from\\none or more issues: they (1) rely on expert knowledge for feature\\nextraction; (2) incur heavy computation cost and are inappropriate\\nfor GPU devices; (3) support only uni-variate timeseries; (4) perform\\nclassification solely. Some work [61] shows that the transformed-\\nbased methods outperform these traditional methods especially on\\nmulti-variate timeseries.\\nIn particular, as the SOTA of timeseries representation learn-\\ning, GRAIL [40] extracts landmarks from data and computes the\\nrepresentations with the combination of the landmarks. However,\\nGRAIL only supports uni-variate timeseries. Our experiments (Sec. 6.4)\\nshow that RITA significantly outperforms GRAIL in both effective-\\nness and efficiency on uni-variate timeseries.\\nCNN/RNN-based Deep Learning Methods. CNN-based methods,\\nsuch as InceptionTime [21] and Resnet [19], are good at classifica-\\ntion tasks, but can not handle generative tasks such as forecasting\\nbecause of the inductive bias of convolution networks. RNN-based\\nmethods, such as Brit [7] and deepAR [44], are capable for classifi-\\ncation, regression and generation. However, the recurrent structure\\nbrings a lot of problems: (1) limiting the model’s ability in captur-\\ning long-range correlation; (2) notoriously difficult to train [41]\\nbecause of gradient vanishing and exploding problem. As a result,\\nsuch methods can hardly scale to very long timeseries.\\nTransformer-based Deep Learning Methods. Given that Trans-\\nformer is the best choice for backbone in almost all sequence mod-\\neling tasks, some effort has been made to apply Transformer to\\ntimeseries analytics. Targeting forecasting of uni-variate timeseries,\\nLogTrans [30] introduced a log sparsity assumption to attention\\ncomputation. Informer [62] pushes LogTrans a step further and\\nscales forecasting to multi-variate timeseries. Autoformer [57] per-\\nforms forecasting by decomposing timeseries into two parts, i.e.\\nthe trend part and the seasonal part.\\nFor imputation tasks, CDSA [37] outperforms statistical meth-\\nods and the SOTA of RNN-based method Brit [7] on 3 public and\\n2 competition datasets. For timeseries classification, AutoTrans-\\nformer [43] performs architecture search to adapt to the tasks\\nin different domains. For timeseries anomaly detection, Anomaly\\nTransformer [58] outperforms many widely-used methods such\\nas OmniAnomaly [47], assuming the attention score maps show\\nGaussian distribution.\\nAll of these works are designed for specific tasks, rather than\\nfunctioning as a representation learning framework to serve\\ndifferent downstream tasks. To fill this gap, some researchers pro-\\nposed a Transformer-based architecture, called TST [61]. Like RITA,\\nTST supports regression, classification, and unsupervised learning\\nthrough the “cloze test” pretraining task on timeseries. However,\\nTST directly uses the classical Vanilla self-attention, thus not scal-\\nable to long timeseries as shown in our experiments (Sec. 6.3.2).\\n7.2\\nEfficient Transformers\\nThe need of improving the scalability of Transformers has led to\\nmore efficient variations of Transformers, especially for accommo-\\ndating long text data in NLP [49].\\nIntroducing fixed/random patterns to self-attention mechanism\\nis an intuitive idea. Sparse Transformer [9] and Longformer [3] only\\ncompute attention at fixed intervals. ETC [2] and BigBird [60] use\\nglobal-local attention: the attention computation is limited within\\na fixed radius, while some auxiliary tokens are added to attend/get\\nattended globally. The deficiencies of fixed attention patterns are\\nobvious: it heavily depends on users to give an optimal setting.\\nTo decrease the reliance on human labor, some works seek to\\nintroduce learnable/adaptive attention patterns instead of fixed\\npatterns. Reformer [26] proposed only computing the dominant\\nattention terms based on their observation of sparsity in atten-\\ntion matrix from language/image data. Such sparsity is intuitive\\nin language data, in which a word’s attention mainly focuses on\\nthe nearby sentences. However, attention in timeseries data shows\\nstrong seasonal patterns rather than sparse patterns, mainly as\\n9\\nresult of the periodicity of timeseries data. Therefore, such works\\ndo not work well for timeseries.\\nApart from introducing attention patterns, some works seek\\nto solve this problem with applied mathematics techniques. Lin-\\nformer [54] performs a projection to decrease the size of query,\\nkey and value matrices before attention computation, because the\\nattention matrix tends to be low-ranked. Performer [10] uses linear\\nfunctions to approximate the kernel function softmax, making at-\\ntention computation commutative. When the sequence length is far\\ngreater than the dimension of embedding vectors, Performer ben-\\nefits from changing the order of matrix multiplication. Linformer\\nand Performer do not depend on the unique properties of language\\ndata, thus potentially fitting timeseries better than other techniques,\\nwhich is why we compared against them in our experiments. How-\\never as shown in Sec. 6, our group attention significantly outper-\\nforms them in both accuracy and efficiency (training time), because\\ngroup attention fully leverages the periodicity of timeseries.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we presented RITA, an automatic, self-supervised, and\\nscalable timeseries analytics tool. RITA effectively adapts Trans-\\nformer, popular in NLP, into timeseries analytics. As the key com-\\nponent of RITA, group attention eliminates the performance bottle-\\nneck of the classical self-attention mechanisms, thus successfully\\nscaling RITA to highly complex, long timeseries data. Our experi-\\nments confirm that RITA significantly speeds up the state-of-the-art\\nby 63X with a better accuracy.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen,\\nCraig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al.\\n2016.

All models were trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100\\n16GB GPU. All the methods are optimized with AdamW [36] of\\nwhich the starting learning rate and weight decay parameter are\\nboth 1𝑒−4. In full-label training scenario, we train the models for\\n100 epochs. In “pretraining + few-label finetuning scenario”, as the\\npretrained models require fewer epochs to converge [61], we train\\nthe model for 50 epochs. For a fair comparison, the baselines use a\\nmaximal batch size within GPU’s capacity during training.\\nAs for model hyper-parameter setting, RITA and the baselines\\nuse a Transformer structure balancing Vanilla ’s accuracy and\\nefficiency: 8-layer stack of 2-head attention with hidden vectors\\nin dimension of 64. Convolution kernel size is set to 5 by default.\\nWe set the error bound threshold (𝜖, Sec. 5.1) of Group Attention\\nto 2, as it balances the accuracy and the efficiency in general on\\nall datasets. Because Linformer requires the users to set the sizes\\nof projection matrix, in different settings we choose an accuracy-\\nefficiency balancing one among {64,128,256,512}.\\nA.2\\nEfficient Computation of Group Attention\\nAlgorithm 1 Efficient Computation of Group Attention\\nRequire: 𝑄,𝑉, 𝑅,𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇, 𝐵𝐸𝐿𝑂𝑁𝐺\\nEnsure: 𝑄,𝑉∈R𝑛∗𝑑,𝑅∈R𝑁∗𝑑,𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇∈N𝑁,𝐵𝐸𝐿𝑂𝑁𝐺∈N𝑛\\n1: function group_attention(𝑄,𝑉, 𝑅)\\n2:\\nfor 𝑖= 0 →𝑁−1 do\\n3:\\ne𝑣𝑖←Í𝑛−1\\n𝑗=0 (𝐵𝐸𝐿𝑂𝑁𝐺𝑗== 𝑖)𝑣𝑗\\n4:\\ne𝑃←𝑄𝑅𝑇\\n5:\\nfor 𝑖= 0 →𝑛−1 do\\n6:\\nfor 𝑗= 0 →𝑁−1 do\\n7:\\n𝑤𝑖,𝑗←𝑒𝑥𝑝(e𝑃𝑖,𝑗)𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇𝑗\\n8:\\nfor 𝑖= 0 →𝑛−1 do\\n9:\\n𝑠𝑖←Í𝑁−1\\n𝑗=0 𝑤𝑖,𝑗\\n10:\\nfor 𝑖= 0 →𝑛−1 do\\n11:\\n𝑜𝑖←Í𝑁−1\\n𝑗=0\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝( e𝑃𝑖,𝑗)\\n𝑠𝑖\\ne𝑣𝑗\\n12:\\nreturn 𝑂\\nIn Alg. 1, we denote𝐶𝑂𝑈𝑁𝑇𝑖to be the size of the 𝑖𝑡ℎgroup, 𝑁to\\nbe the number of groups, r𝑖to be the representative key of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ\\ngroup and R to be the matrix consisting of all r𝑖, 𝐵𝐸𝐿𝑂𝑁𝐺𝑖to be\\nthe group that k𝑖belongs to.

We assume\\nthat Scipy [53] learns an optimal function in Line 4 so that function\\nCOST gives the optimal estimation error when fitting the points in\\nset 𝑆. When fitting very few points, we assign an infinite cost to\\nprevent a biased fitting function (Line 2). 𝑔(𝑛) denotes the minimal\\nestimation error for points in sub-plane {𝑙2 ≤𝐿≤𝑙1, 𝑁≤𝑛}. In\\nLines 11-13, we enumerate all possible ways of cutting {𝑙2 ≤𝐿≤\\n𝑙1, 𝑁≤𝑛} horizontally into two sub-plane {𝑙2 ≤𝐿≤𝑙1, 𝑁≤𝑖} and\\n{𝑙2 ≤𝐿≤𝑙1,𝑖≤𝑁≤𝑛} by iterating 𝑖from 1 to n. Choosing the\\ncutting strategy that minimizes estimation error gets us a𝑔(𝑙1) with\\nminimal estimation error for sub-plane {𝑙2 ≤𝐿≤𝑙1, 𝑁≤𝑙1}, which\\nis recorded as 𝑓𝑙1,𝑙2 in Line 14. 𝑑𝑝(𝑙) denotes the minimal estimation\\nerror for sub-plane {𝐿≤𝑙}. We enumerate all the possible ways\\nof cutting {𝐿≤𝑙} vertically into two sub-plane {𝐿≤𝑖} and {𝑖≤\\n𝐿≤𝑙} by iterating 𝑖from 1 to 𝑙(Line 17-19). Finally, we have the\\nminimal estimation error for the whole plane as 𝑑𝑝(𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥).

In this section, we\\nshow that with minimal modification RITA can effectively support\\nclassification, imputation and forecasting tasks. Other unsupervised\\ntasks such as similarity search or clustering are naturally supported\\nby extracting feature embeddings from RITA.\\nA.7.1\\nClassification\\nTo classify timeseries, we input timeseries to the model as described\\nin Sec. 3 and attach a special token [CLS] as the first input em-\\nbedding. [CLS]’s embedding acts as the embedding for the entire\\ntimeseries, and the output representation of [CLS] is fed into a\\nclassifier: y = Softmax(WclsZ[CLS] + Bcls), where 𝑍[𝐶𝐿𝑆] ∈R𝑑is\\nthe output representation of [CLS], C is the number of classes, and\\nWcls ∈RC×d, Bcls ∈RC are learnable parameters for classification\\ntask. The result vector 𝑦∈R𝐶represents the possibility that the\\ninput timeseries belongs to each class.\\nWe apply Cross Entropy Loss as the loss function of the classi-\\nfication task [13]: L = 1\\nC\\nÍC\\ni=1 −ˆy(i)log(y(i)), where ˆ𝑦is a binary\\nindicator for ground truth label:\\nˆ𝑦(𝑖) =\\n(\\n1\\n𝑖is ground truth label\\n0\\n𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒\\n(16)\\nA.7.2\\nImputation\\nTimeseries are mainly generated by sensors, a common problem\\nof which is missing values. This becomes a challenge when many\\ndownstream analytics require the missing values to be recovered.\\nThe recovering task is imputation.\\nDenote the real timeseries as𝑇𝑟∈R𝑡×𝑚, the observed timeseries\\nwith missing values as 𝑇𝑜∈R𝑡×𝑚, and the set of missing values’\\npositions as 𝑀. We scale the values of all timeseries to non-negative\\nand use a special value (-1) to indicate missing values:\\n𝑇𝑜(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n−1\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝑀\\n𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∉𝑀\\n(17)\\n𝑇𝑜is fed into the RITA as input, and the output representa-\\ntions are concatenated and fed into a Transpose Convolution layer\\nwhich decodes the output embedding vectors from hidden space to\\ntimeseries values, corresponding to the convolution operation in\\n13\\nthe input stage, i.e., Y = TransposeCNN (Z1 +○Z2 +○... +○Zn), where\\n𝑌∈R𝑡×𝑚is the recovered timeseries, and 𝑍𝑖∈R𝑑is the output of\\neach position.\\nHere Mean Square Error is chosen as the loss function [51]:\\n𝐿=\\n1\\n|𝑀|\\nÍ\\n(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝑀(𝑌(𝑖, 𝑗) −𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗))2.\\nA.7.3\\nForecasting\\nForecasting can be regarded as a special case of imputation, in\\nwhich all missing values are at the end of timeseries.\\nSo like in imputation task, we scale the timeseries to non-\\nnegative and use a special value (-1) to indicate the values to be\\npredicted:\\n𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n𝑖≤𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑\\n−1\\n𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒\\n(18)\\nWhere 𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑is the observed timestamp. Then the output\\nrepresentations are fed into a Transpose Convolution layer using\\nMean Squared Error as loss function, as described above.\\nA.7.4\\nOther Unsupervised Tasks\\nRITA naturally supports other unsupervised tasks, such as similar-\\nity search and clustering [25, 31, 32], by producing the embedding\\nof one timeseries (output representation of the special token [CLS]).\\nClustering can be performed on the embeddings with flexible choice\\nof distance metrics. Similarly, a high dimensional similarity search\\nsystem [22, 23, 38] can be built on the embeddings.\\nA.8\\nInference Time\\nDataset\\nLength\\nTST[61]\\nVanilla\\nPerformer\\nLinformer\\nGroup Attn.\\nWISDM\\n200\\n2.18\\n2.26\\n2.35\\n2.22\\n2.17\\nHHAR\\n200\\n1.19\\n1.23\\n1.28\\n1.21\\n1.18\\nRWHAR\\n200\\n1.32\\n1.37\\n1.42\\n1.34\\n1.31\\nECG\\n2000\\n18.44\\n15.26\\n5.80\\n6.08\\n5.16\\nTable 6: Inference time: Classification on multi-variate data\\n(seconds).\\nDataset\\nLength\\nTST[61]\\nVanilla\\nPerformer\\nLinformer\\nGroup Attn.\\nWISDM\\n200\\n2.03\\n2.11\\n2.19\\n2.07\\n2.02\\nHHAR\\n200\\n1.11\\n1.14\\n1.19\\n1.12\\n1.10\\nRWHAR\\n200\\n1.23\\n1.27\\n1.32\\n1.25\\n1.22\\nECG\\n2000\\n17.22\\n14.32\\n4.73\\n4.99\\n4.11\\nMGH\\n10000\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n6.58\\n6.88\\n1.35\\nTable 7: Inference time: Imputation on multi-variate data\\n(seconds).\\nIn this section, we present the average inference time on valida-\\ntion sets.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Wikipedia', 'title': 'Attention is all you need'}, page_content='Page: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\\nAs of 2024, the paper has been cited more than 140,000 times.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryōsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Love\\nSummary: \"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967, with \"Baby, You\\'re a Rich Man\" as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain\\'s contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were shown performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon\\'s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show\\'s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture\\'s embrace of flower power philosophy.\\nOur World coincide'),\n",

This survey provides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the literature. The\\nvarious attention mechanisms are explained by means of a framework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a\\ncomprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various measures for evaluating attention models are reviewed,\\nand methods to characterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework are discussed. Last, future work in\\nthe ﬁeld of attention models is considered.\\nIndex Terms—Attention models, deep learning, introductory and survey, neural nets, supervised learning\\n!\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nT\\nHE idea of mimicking human attention ﬁrst arose in the\\nﬁeld of computer vision [1], [2] in an attempt to reduce\\nthe computational complexity of image processing while\\nimproving performance by introducing a model that would\\nonly focus on speciﬁc regions of images instead of the entire\\npicture. Although, the true starting point of the attention\\nmechanisms we know today is often attributed to originate\\nin the ﬁeld of natural language processing [3]. Bahdanau et\\nal. [3] implement attention in a machine translation model to\\naddress certain issues with the structure of recurrent neural\\nnetworks. After Bahdanau et al. [3] emphasized the advan-\\ntages of attention, the attention techniques were reﬁned [4]\\nand quickly became popular for a variety of tasks, such as\\ntext classiﬁcation [5], [6], image captioning [7], [8], sentiment\\nanalysis [6], [9], and speech recognition [10], [11], [12].\\nAttention has become a popular technique in deep learn-\\ning for several reasons. Firstly, models that incorporate\\nattention mechanisms attain state-of-the-art results for all\\nof the previously mentioned tasks, and many others. Fur-\\nthermore, most attention mechanisms can be trained jointly\\nwith a base model, such as a recurrent neural network or\\na convolutional neural network using regular backpropa-\\ngation [3]. Additionally, attention introduces a certain type\\nof interpretation into neural network models [8] that are\\ngenerally known to be highly complicated to interpret.\\nMoreover, the popularity of attention mechanisms was ad-\\nditionally boosted after the introduction of the Transformer\\nmodel [13] that further proved how effective attention can\\nbe. Attention was originally introduced as an extension to\\nrecurrent neural networks [14]. However, the Transformer\\nmodel proposed in [13] poses a major development in at-\\ntention research as it demonstrates that the attention mech-\\nanism is sufﬁcient to build a state-of-the-art model. This\\nmeans that disadvantages, such as the fact that recurrent\\nneural networks are particularly difﬁcult to parallelize, can\\nG. Brauwers and F.

As was the case for the introduction\\nof the original attention mechanism [3], the Transformer\\nmodel was created for machine translation, but was quickly\\nadopted to be used for other tasks, such as image processing\\n[15], video processing [16], and recommender systems [17].\\nThe purpose of this survey is to explain the general\\nform of attention, and provide a comprehensive overview\\nof attention techniques in deep learning. Other surveys have\\nalready been published on the subject of attention models.\\nFor example, in [18], a survey is presented on attention in\\ncomputer vision, [19] provides an overview of attention in\\ngraph models, and [20], [21], [22] are all surveys on attention\\nin natural language processing. This paper partly builds\\non the information presented in the previously mentioned\\nsurveys. Yet, we provide our own signiﬁcant contributions.\\nThe main difference between this survey and the previously\\nmentioned ones is that the other surveys generally focus\\non attention models within a certain domain. This survey,\\nhowever, provides a cross-domain overview of attention\\ntechniques. We discuss the attention techniques in a general\\nway, allowing them to be understood and applied in a\\nvariety of domains. Furthermore, we found the taxonomies\\npresented in previous surveys to be lacking the depth and\\nstructure needed to properly distinguish the various atten-\\ntion mechanisms. Additionally, certain signiﬁcant attention\\ntechniques have not yet been properly discussed in previ-\\nous surveys, while other presented attention mechanisms\\nseem to be lacking either technical details or intuitive ex-\\nplanations. Therefore, in this paper, we present important\\nattention techniques by means of a single framework using\\na uniform notation, a combination of both technical and in-\\ntuitive explanations for each presented attention technique,\\nand a comprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms.\\nThe structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 in-\\ntroduces a general attention model that provides the reader\\nwith a basic understanding of the properties of attention\\nand how it can be applied. One of the main contributions\\nof this paper is the taxonomy of attention techniques pre-\\nsented in Section 3. In this section, attention mechanisms\\nare explained and categorized according to the presented\\narXiv:2203.14263v1  [cs.LG]  27 Mar 2022\\n2\\nFeature Model\\nQuery Model\\nAttention Model\\nOutput Model\\nFig. 1.

Section 4 provides an overview of performance\\nmeasures and methods for evaluating attention models.\\nFurthermore, the taxonomy is used to evaluate the structure\\nof various attention models. Lastly, in Section 5, we give our\\nconclusions and suggestions for further research.\\n2\\nGENERAL ATTENTION MODEL\\nThis section presents a general form of attention with cor-\\nresponding notation. The notation introduced here is based\\non the notation that was introduced in [23] and popularized\\nin [13]. The framework presented in this section is used\\nthroughout the rest of this paper.\\nTo implement a general attention model, it is necessary\\nto ﬁrst describe the general characteristics of a model that\\ncan employ attention. First of all, we will refer to the\\ncomplete model as the task model, of which the structure is\\npresented in Fig. 1. This model simply takes an input, carries\\nout the speciﬁed task, and produces the desired output. For\\nexample, the task model can be a language model that takes\\nas input a piece of text, and produces as output a summary\\nof the contents, a classiﬁcation of the sentiment, or the text\\ntranslated word for word to another language. Alternatively,\\nthe task model can take an image, and produce a caption\\nor segmentation for that image. The task model consists of\\nfour submodels: the feature model, the query model, the\\nattention model, and the output model. In Subsection 2.1,\\nthe feature model and query model are discussed, which\\nare used to prepare the input for the attention calculation.\\nIn Subsection 2.2, the attention model and output model are\\ndiscussed, which are concerned with producing the output.\\n2.1\\nAttention Input\\nSuppose the task model takes as input the matrix X ∈\\nRdx×nx, where dx represents the size of the input vectors\\nand nx represents the amount of input vectors. The columns\\nin this matrix can represent the words in a sentence,\\nthe pixels in an image, the characteristics of an acoustic\\nsequence, or any other collection of inputs. The feature\\nmodel is then employed to extract the nf feature vectors\\nf1, . . . , fnf ∈Rdf from X, where df represents the size of\\nthe feature vectors. The feature model can be a recurrent\\nneural network (RNN), a convolutional neural network\\n(CNN), a simple embedding layer, a linear transformation\\nof the original data, or no transformation at all. Essentially,\\nthe feature model consists of all the steps that transform the\\noriginal input X into the feature vectors f1, . . . , fnf that the\\nattention model will attend to.\\nAttention\\nAlignment\\nAttention\\nScores\\nWeighted\\nAverage\\nKeys\\nValues\\nFig. 2. The inner mechanisms of the general attention module.\\nTo determine which vectors to attend to, the attention\\nmodel requires the query q ∈Rdq, where dq indicates the\\nsize of the query vector. This query is extracted by the\\nquery model, and is generally designed based on the type\\nof output that is desired of the model. A query tells the\\nattention model which feature vectors to attend to. It can be\\ninterpreted literally as a query, or a question. For example,\\nfor the task of image captioning, suppose that one uses a\\ndecoder RNN model to produce the output caption based\\non feature vectors obtained from the image by a CNN. At\\neach prediction step, the hidden state of the RNN model can\\nbe used as a query to attend to the CNN feature vectors. In\\neach step, the query is a question in the sense that it asks for\\nthe necessary information from the feature vectors based on\\nthe current prediction context.\\n2.2\\nAttention Output\\nThe feature vectors and query are used as input for the\\nattention model. This model consists of a single, or a\\ncollection of general attention modules. An overview of a\\ngeneral attention module is presented in Fig. 2. The input of\\nthe general attention module is the query q ∈Rdq, and the\\nmatrix of feature vectors F = [f1, . . . , fnf ] ∈Rdf ×nf . Two\\nseparate matrices are extracted from the matrix F : the keys\\nmatrix K = [k1, . . . , knf ] ∈Rdk×nf , and the values matrix\\nV = [v1, . . . , vnf ] ∈Rdv×nf , where dk and dv indicate,\\nrespectively, the dimensions of the key vectors (columns\\nof K) and value vectors (columns of V ). The general way\\nof obtaining these matrices is through a linear transforma-\\ntion of F using the weight matrices WK ∈Rdk×df and\\nWV ∈Rdv×df , for K and V , respectively. The calculations\\nof K and V are presented in (1). Both weight matrices can\\nbe learned during training or predeﬁned by the researcher.\\nFor example, one can choose to deﬁne both WK and WV\\nas equal to the identity matrix to retain the original feature\\nvectors. Other ways of deﬁning the keys and the values are\\nalso possible, such as using completely separate inputs for\\nthe keys and values. The only constraint to be obeyed is that\\nthe number of columns in K and V remains the same.\\nK\\ndk×nf\\n= WK\\ndk×df\\n×\\nF\\ndf ×nf\\n,\\nV\\ndv×nf\\n= WV\\ndv×df\\n×\\nF\\ndf ×nf\\n.\\n(1)\\nThe goal of the attention module is to produce a\\nweighted average of the value vectors in V . The weights\\nused to produce this output are obtained via an attention\\nscoring and alignment step. The query q and the keys\\nmatrix K are used to calculate the vector of attention scores\\n3\\ne = [e1, . . . , enf ] ∈Rnf . This is done via the score function\\nscore(), as illustrated in (2).\\nel\\n1×1 = score( q\\ndq×1, kl\\ndk×1).\\n(2)\\nAs discussed before, the query symbolizes a request for in-\\nformation. The attention score el represents how important\\nthe information contained in the key vector kl is according\\nto the query. If the dimensions of the query and key vectors\\nare the same, an example of a score function would be to\\ntake the dot-product of the vectors. The different types of\\nscore functions are further discussed in Section 3.2.1.\\nNext, the attention scores are processed further through\\nan alignment layer. The attention scores can generally have\\na wide range outside of [0, 1]. However, since the goal is to\\nproduce a weighted average, the scores are redistributed via\\nan alignment function align() as deﬁned in (3).\\nal\\n1×1 = align( el\\n1×1; e\\nnf ×1),\\n(3)\\nwhere al ∈R1 is the attention weight corresponding to\\nthe lth value vector. One example of an alignment function\\nwould be to use a softmax function, but the various other\\nalignment types are discussed in Section 3.2.2. The attention\\nweights provide a rather intuitive interpretation for the\\nattention module. Each weight is a direct indication of how\\nimportant each feature vector is relative to the others for\\nthis particular problem. This can provide us with a more\\nin-depth understanding of the model behaviour, and the re-\\nlations between inputs and outputs. The vector of attention\\nweights a = [a1, . . . , anf ] ∈Rnf is used to produce the\\ncontext vector c ∈Rdv by calculating a weighted average of\\nthe columns of the values matrix V , as shown in (4).\\nc\\ndv×1\\n=\\nnf\\nX\\nl=1\\nal\\n1×1\\n× vl\\ndv×1\\n.\\n(4)\\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, the context vector is then used in\\nthe output model to create the output ˆy. This output model\\ntranslates the context vector into an output prediction. For\\nexample, it could be a simple softmax layer that takes as\\ninput the context vector c, as shown in (5).\\nˆy\\ndy×1 = softmax( Wc\\ndy×dv\\n×\\nc\\ndv×1 + bc\\ndy×1),\\n(5)\\nwhere dy is the number of output choices or classes, and\\nWc ∈Rdy×dv and bc ∈Rdy are trainable weights.\\n2.3\\nAttention Applications\\nAttention is a rather general mechanism that can be used in\\na wide variety of problem domains. Consider the task of ma-\\nchine translation using an RNN model. Also, consider the\\nproblem of image classiﬁcation using a basic CNN model.\\nWhile an RNN produces a sequence of hidden state vectors,\\na CNN creates feature maps, where each region in the image\\nis represented by a feature vector. The RNN hidden states\\nare organized sequentially, while the CNN feature maps\\nare organized spatially. Yet, attention can still be applied\\nin both situations, since the attention mechanism does not\\ninherently depend on the organization of the feature vectors.\\nThis characteristic makes attention easy to implement in a\\nwide variety of models in different domains.\\nAnother domain where attention can be applied is audio\\nprocessing [24], [25]. Acoustic sequences can be represented\\nby a sequence of feature vectors that relate to certain time\\nperiods of the audio sample. These vectors could simply\\nbe the raw input audio, or they can be extracted via, for\\nexample, an RNN or CNN. Video processing is another\\ndomain where attention can be applied intuitively [26], [27].\\nVideo data consists of sequences of images, so attention can\\nbe applied to the individual images, as well as the entire\\nsequence. Recommender systems often incorporate a user’s\\ninteraction history to produce recommendations. Feature\\nvectors can be extracted based on, for example, the id’s\\nor other characteristics of the products the user interacted\\nwith, and attention can be applied to them [28]. Attention\\ncan generally also be applied to many problems that use\\na time series as input, be it medical [29], ﬁnancial [30], or\\nanything else, as long as feature vectors can be extracted.\\nThe fact that attention does not rely on the organization\\nof the feature vectors allows it to be applied to various\\nproblems that each use data with different structures, as\\nillustrated by the previous domain examples. Yet, this can be\\ntaken even further by applying attention to data where there\\nis irregular structure. For example, protein structures, city\\ntrafﬁc ﬂows, and communication networks cannot always\\nbe represented using neatly structured organizations, such\\nas sequences, like time series, or grids, like images. In such\\ncases, the different aspects of the data are often represented\\nas nodes in a graph. These nodes can be represented by\\nfeature vectors, meaning that attention can be applied in\\ndomains that use graph-structured data as well [19], [31].\\nIn general, attention can be applied to any problem for\\nwhich a set of feature vectors can be deﬁned or extracted.\\nAs such, the general attention model presented in Fig. 2 is\\napplicable to a wide range of domains. The problem, how-\\never, is that there is a large variety of different applications\\nand extensions of the general attention module. As such,\\nin Section 3, a comprehensive overview is provided of a\\ncollection of different attention mechanisms.\\n3\\nATTENTION TAXONOMY\\nThere are many different types of attention mechanisms\\nand extensions, and a model can use different combina-\\ntions of these attention techniques. As such, we propose\\na taxonomy that can be used to classify different types of\\nattention mechanisms. Fig. 3 provides a visual overview of\\nthe different categories and subcategories that the attention\\nmechanisms can be organized in. The three major categories\\nare based on whether an attention technique is designed\\nto handle speciﬁc types of feature vectors (feature-related),\\nspeciﬁc types of model queries (query-related), or whether\\nit is simply a general mechanism that is related to neither\\nthe feature model, nor the query model (general). Further\\nexplanations of these categories and their subcategories are\\nprovided in the following subsections. Each mechanism\\ndiscussed in this section is either a modiﬁcation to the\\nexisting inner mechanisms of the general attention module\\npresented in Section 2, or an extension of it.\\nThe presented taxonomy can also be used to analyze\\nthe architecture of attention models. Namely, the major\\ncategories and their subcategories can be interpreted as\\n4\\nAttention Mechanisms\\nFeature-Related\\nQuery-Related\\nGeneral\\nMultiplicity\\nLevels\\nRepresentations\\nScoring\\nAlignment\\nMultiplicity\\nType\\nDimensionality\\nSingular Features Attention\\nCoarse-Grained Co-Attention\\nFine-Grained Co-Attention\\nMulti-Grained Co-Attention\\nRotatory Attention\\nSingle-Level Attention\\nAttention-via-Attention\\nHierarchical Attention\\nSingle-Representational Attention\\nMulti-Representational Attention\\nAdditive Scoring\\nMultiplicative Scoring\\nScaled Multiplicative Scoring\\nGeneral Scoring\\nBiased General Scoring\\nActivated General Scoring\\nSimilarity Scoring\\nGlobal/Soft Alignment\\nHard Alignment\\nLocal Alignment\\nReinforced Alignment\\nSingle-Dimensional Attention\\nMulti-Dimensional Attention\\nBasic Queries\\nSpecialized Queries\\nSelf-Attentive Queries\\nAlternating Co-Attention\\nInteractive Co-Attention\\nParallel Co-Attention\\nSingular Query Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nMulti-Hop Attention\\nCapsule-Based Attention\\nFig. 3.

An attention\\nmodel can consist of a combination of techniques taken\\nfrom any or all categories. Some characteristics, such as\\nthe scoring and alignment functions, are generally required\\nfor any attention model. Other mechanisms, such as multi-\\nhead attention or co-attention are not necessary in every\\nsituation. Lastly, in Table 1, an overview of used notation\\nwith corresponding descriptions is provided.\\n3.1\\nFeature-Related Attention Mechanisms\\nBased on a particular set of input data, a feature model\\nextracts feature vectors so that the attention model can\\nattend to these various vectors. These features may have\\nspeciﬁc structures that require special attention mechanisms\\nto handle them. These mechanisms can be categorized to\\ndeal with one of the following feature characteristics: the\\nmultiplicity of features, the levels of features, or the repre-\\nsentations of features.\\n3.1.1\\nMultiplicity of Features\\nFor most tasks, a model only processes a single input, such\\nas an image, a sentence, or an acoustic sequence. We refer\\nto such a mechanism as singular features attention. Other\\nmodels are designed to use attention based on multiple\\ninputs to allow one to introduce more information into the\\nmodel that can be exploited in various ways. However, this\\ndoes imply the presence of multiple feature matrices that\\nrequire special attention mechanisms to be fully used. For\\nexample, [32] introduces a concept named co-attention to\\nallow the proposed visual question answering (VQA) model\\nto jointly attend to both an image and a question.\\nCo-attention mechanisms can generally be split up\\ninto two groups [33]: coarse-grained co-attention and\\nﬁne-grained co-attention. The difference between the two\\ngroups is the way attention scores are calculated based on\\nthe two feature matrices. Coarse-grained attention mecha-\\nnisms use a compact representation of one feature matrix\\nas a query when attending to the other feature vectors.\\nFine-grained co-attention, on the other hand, uses all feature\\nvectors of one input as queries. As such, no information is\\nlost, which is why these mechanisms are called ﬁne-grained.\\nAs an example of coarse-grained co-attention, [32] pro-\\nposes an alternating co-attention mechanism that uses the\\ncontext vector (which is a compact representation) from one\\nattention module as the query for the other module, and\\nvice versa. Alternating co-attention is presented in Fig. 4.\\nGiven a set of two input matrices X(1) and X(2), features\\nare extracted by a feature model to produce the feature\\nmatrices F (1) ∈Rd(1)\\nf\\n×n(1)\\nf\\nand F (2) ∈Rd(2)\\nf\\n×n(2)\\nf , where d(1)\\nf\\n5\\nAttention\\nModule1\\nAttention\\nModule2\\n\\x97(1)\\n\\x97(2)\\n®(0)\\n®(2)\\nAttention\\nModule1\\n\\x97(1)\\n®(1)\\nFig. 4.

In [32],\\nco-attention is used for VQA, so the two input matrices are\\nthe image data and the question data, for which the feature\\nmodel for the image consists of a CNN model, and the\\nfeature model for the question consists of word embeddings,\\na convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and an LSTM model.\\nFirstly, attention is calculated for the ﬁrst set of features F (1)\\nwithout the use of a query (Attention Module1 in Fig. 4). In\\n[32], an adjusted additive attention score function is used for\\nthis attention mechanism. The general form of the regular\\nadditive score function can be seen in (6).\\nscore( q\\ndq×1\\n, kl\\ndk×1\\n) = wT\\n1×dw\\n×act(W1\\ndw×dq\\n× q\\ndq×1\\n+ W2\\ndw×dk\\n× kl\\ndk×1\\n+ b\\ndw×1\\n), (6)\\nwhere act() is a non-linear activation function, and w ∈\\nRdw, W1 ∈Rdw×dq, W2 ∈Rdw×dk, and b ∈Rdw are\\ntrainable weights matrices, for which dw is a predeﬁned\\ndimension of the weight matrices. A variant of this score\\nfunction adapted to be calculated without a query for the\\napplication at hand can be seen in (7).\\ne(0)\\nl\\n1×1\\n= w(1)T\\n1×dw\\n× act(W (1)\\ndw×d(1)\\nk\\n× k(1)\\nl\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n+ b(1)\\ndw×1\\n),\\n(7)\\nwhere w(1) ∈Rdw, W (1) ∈Rdw×d(1)\\nk , and b(1) ∈Rdw are\\ntrainable weight matrices for Attention Module1, k(1)\\nl\\n∈\\nRd(1)\\nk\\nis the lth column of the keys matrix K(1) that was\\nobtained from F (1) via a linear transformation (see (1)), for\\nwhich dw is a prespeciﬁed dimension of the weight matrices\\nand d(1)\\nk\\nis a prespeciﬁed dimension of the key vectors.\\nPerhaps one may wonder why the query is absent when\\ncalculating attention in this manner. Essentially, the query in\\nthis attention model is learned alongside the other trainable\\nparameters. As such, the query can be interpreted as a\\ngeneral question: ”Which feature vectors contain the most\\nimportant information?”. This is also known as a self-\\nattentive mechanism, since attention is calculated based\\nonly on the feature vectors themselves. Self-attention is\\nexplained in more detail in Subsection 3.3.1.\\nThe scores are combined with an alignment function\\n(see (3)), such as the softmax function, to create attention\\nweights used to calculate the context vector c(0) ∈Rd(1)\\nv\\n(see (4)). This context vector is not used as the output of\\nthe attention model, but rather as a query for calculating\\nthe context vector c(2) ∈Rd(2)\\nv , based on the second feature\\nmatrix F (2), where d(2)\\nv\\nis the dimension of the value vectors\\nobtained from F (2) via a linear transformation (see (1)).

Attention scores are\\ncalculated according to (9). In [32], the same function and\\nweight matrices as seen in (7) are used, but with an added\\nquery making it the same as the general additive score\\nfunction (see (6)). The rest of the attention calculation is\\nsimilar as before.\\ne(1)\\nl\\n1×1\\n= score( c(2)\\nd(2)\\nv\\n×1\\n, k(1)\\nl\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n).\\n(9)\\nThe produced context vectors c(1) and c(2) are concatenated\\nand used for prediction in the output model. Alternating\\nco-attention inherently contains a form of sequentiality due\\nto the fact that context vectors need to be calculated one\\nafter another. This may come with a computational dis-\\nadvantage since it is not possible to parallelize. Instead of\\nusing a sequential mechanism like alternating co-attention,\\n[34] proposes the interactive co-attention mechanism that\\ncan calculate attention on both feature matrices in parallel,\\nas depicted in Fig. 5. Instead of using the context vectors as\\nqueries, unweighted averages of the key vectors are used as\\nqueries. The calculation of the average keys are provided in\\n(10), and the calculation of the attention scores are shown\\nin (11). Any score function can be used in this case, but an\\nadditive score function is used in [34].\\n¯k(1)\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n=\\n1\\nn(1)\\nf\\nn(1)\\nf\\nX\\nl=1\\nk(1)\\nl\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n,\\n¯k(2)\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×1\\n=\\n1\\nn(2)\\nf\\nn(2)\\nf\\nX\\nl=1\\nk(2)\\nl\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×1\\n;\\n(10)\\ne(1)\\nl\\n1×1\\n= score( ¯k(2)\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×1\\n, k(1)\\nl\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n), e(2)\\nl\\n1×1\\n= score( ¯k(1)\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×1\\n, k(2)\\nl\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×1\\n). (11)\\nFrom the attention scores, attention weights are created via\\nan alignment function, and are used to produce the context\\nvectors c(1) and c(2).\\nWhile coarse-grained co-attention mechanisms use a\\ncompact representation of one input to use as a query when\\n6\\ncalculating attention for another input, ﬁne-grained co-\\nattention considers every element of each input individually\\nwhen calculating attention scores. In this case, the query\\nbecomes a matrix. An example of ﬁne-grained co-attention\\nis parallel co-attention [32]. Similarly to interactive co-\\nattention, parallel co-attention calculates attention on the\\ntwo feature matrices at the same time, as shown in Fig. 6. We\\nstart by evaluating the keys matrices K(1) ∈Rd(1)\\nk ×n(1)\\nf\\nand\\nK(2) ∈Rd(2)\\nk ×n(2)\\nf\\nthat are obtained by linearly transforming\\nthe feature matrices F (1) and F (2), where d(1)\\nk\\nand d(2)\\nk\\nare\\nprespeciﬁed dimensions of the keys. The idea is to use the\\nkeys matrix from one input as the query for calculating\\nattention on the other input. However, since K(1) and K(2)\\nhave completely different dimensions, an afﬁnity matrix\\nA ∈Rn(1)\\nf\\n×n(2)\\nf\\nis calculated that is used to essentially\\ntranslate one keys matrix to the space of the other keys.\\nIn [32], A is calculated as shown in (12).\\nA\\nn(1)\\nf\\n×n(2)\\nf\\n= act( K(1)T\\nn(1)\\nf\\n×d(1)\\nk\\n×\\nWA\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×d(2)\\nk\\n× K(2)\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×n(2)\\nf\\n),\\n(12)\\nwhere WA ∈Rd(1)\\nk ×d(2)\\nk\\nis a trainable weights matrix and\\nact() is an activation function for which the tanh() function\\nis used in [32]. [35] proposes a different way of calculating\\nthis matrix, i.e., one can use (13) to calculate each individual\\nelement Ai,j of the matrix A.\\nAi,j\\n1×1\\n= wT\\nA\\n1×3dk\\n× concat(k(1)\\ni\\ndk×1\\n, k(2)\\nj\\ndk×1\\n, k(1)\\ni\\ndk×1\\n◦k(2)\\nj\\ndk×1\\n),\\n(13)\\nwhere wA ∈R3dk denotes a trainable vector of weights,\\nconcat() denotes vector concatenation, and ◦denotes\\nelement-wise multiplication, also known as the Hadamard\\nproduct. Note that the keys of each keys matrix in this\\ncase must have the same dimension dk for the element-\\nwise multiplication to work. The afﬁnity matrix can be\\ninterpreted as a similarity matrix for the columns of the two\\nkeys matrices, and helps translate, for example, image keys\\nto the same space as the keys of the words in a sentence,\\nand vice versa. The vectors of attention scores e(1) and e(2)\\ncan be calculated using an altered version of the additive\\nscore function as presented in (14) and (15). The previous\\nattention score examples in this survey all used a score func-\\ntion to calculate each attention score for each value vector\\nindividually. However, (14) and (15) are used to calculate\\nthe complete vector of all attention scores. Essentially, the\\nattention scores are calculated in an aggregated form.\\ne(1)\\n1×n(1)\\nf\\n= w1\\n1×dw\\n×act(W2\\ndw×d(2)\\nk\\n× K(2)\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×n(2)\\nf\\n× AT\\nn(2)\\nf\\n×n(1)\\nf\\n+ W1\\ndw×d(1)\\nk\\n× K(1)\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×n(1)\\nf\\n); (14)\\ne(2)\\n1×n(2)\\nf\\n= w2\\n1×dw\\n×act(W1\\ndw×d(1)\\nk\\n× K(1)\\nd(1)\\nk\\n×n(1)\\nf\\n×\\nA\\nn(1)\\nf\\n×n(2)\\nf\\n+ W2\\ndw×d(2)\\nk\\n× K(2)\\nd(2)\\nk\\n×n(2)\\nf\\n), (15)\\nwhere w1\\n∈\\nRdw, w2\\n∈\\nRdw, W1\\n∈\\nRdw×d(1)\\nk , and\\nW2 ∈Rdw×d(2)\\nk\\nare trainable weight matrices, for which\\ndw is a prespeciﬁed dimension of the weight matrices. Note\\nthat tanh() is used in [32] for the activation function, and the\\nfeature matrices are used as the key matrices. In that case,\\nthe afﬁnity matrix A can be seen as a translator between\\nfeature spaces. As mentioned before, the afﬁnity matrix is\\nessentially a similarity matrix for the key vectors of the two\\nAttention\\nModule1\\nAttention\\nModule2\\n\\x97(1)\\n\\x97(2)\\n\\x9c(1)\\n\\x9c(2)\\n®(1)\\n®(2)\\nAfﬁnity\\nMatrix\\n\\x92\\nFig. 6. An illustration of parallel co-attention.\\ninputs. In [33], this fact is used to propose a different way\\nof determining attention scores. Namely, one could take\\nthe maximum similarity value in a row or column as the\\nattention score, as shown in (16).\\ne(1)\\ni\\n1×1 =\\nmax\\nj=1,...,n(2)\\nf\\nAi,j\\n1×1 ,\\ne(2)\\nj\\n1×1 =\\nmax\\ni=1,...,n(1)\\nf\\nAi,j\\n1×1 .\\n(16)\\nNext, the attention scores are used to calculate attention\\nweights using an alignment function, so that two context\\nvectors c(1) and c(2) can be derived as weighted averages of\\nthe value vectors that are obtained from linearly transform-\\ning the features. For the alignment function, [32] proposes\\nto use a softmax function, and the value vectors are simply\\nset equal to the feature vectors. The resulting context vectors\\ncan be either concatenated or added together.\\nFinally, coarse-grained and ﬁne-grained co-attention can\\nbe combined to create an even more complex co-attention\\nmechanism. [33] proposes the multi-grained co-attention\\nmechanism that calculates both coarse-grained and ﬁne-\\ngrained co-attention for two inputs. Each mechanism pro-\\nduces one context vector per input. The four resulting\\ncontext vectors are concatenated and used in the output\\nmodel for prediction.\\nA mechanism separate from co-attention that still uses\\nmultiple inputs is the rotatory attention mechanism [36].\\nThis technique is typically used in a text sentiment analysis\\nsetting where there are three inputs involved: the phrase for\\nwhich the sentiment needs to be determined (target phrase),\\nthe text before the target phrase (left context), and the text af-\\nter the target phrase (right context). The words in these three\\ninputs are all encoded by the feature model, producing the\\nfollowing feature matrices: F t = [f t\\n1, . . . , f t\\nnt\\nf ] ∈Rdt\\nf ×nt\\nf ,\\nF l = [f l\\n1, . . . , f l\\nnl\\nf ] ∈Rdl\\nf ×nl\\nf , and F r = [f r\\n1 , . . . , f r\\nnr\\nf ] ∈\\nRdr\\nf ×nr\\nf , for the target phrase words, left context words,\\nand right context words, respectively, where dt\\nf, dl\\nf, and\\ndr\\nf represent the dimensions of the feature vectors for the\\ncorresponding inputs, and nt\\nf, nl\\nf, and nr\\nf represent the\\nnumber of feature vectors for the corresponding inputs. The\\nfeature model used in [36] consists of word embeddings\\nand separate Bi-LSTM models for the target phrase, the left\\ncontext, and the right context. This means that the feature\\nvectors are in fact the hidden state vectors obtained from the\\nBi-LSTM models. Using these features, the idea is to extract\\na single vector r from the inputs such that a softmax layer\\ncan be used for classiﬁcation. As such, we are now faced\\nwith two challenges: how to represent the inputs as a single\\nvector, and how to incorporate the information from the left\\nand right context into that vector. [36] proposes to use the\\nrotatory attention mechanism for this purpose.\\n7\\nFirstly, a single target phrase representation is created\\nby using a pooling layer that takes the average over the\\ncolumns of F t, as shown in (17).\\nrt\\ndt\\nf ×1\\n= 1\\nnt\\nf\\nnt\\nf\\nX\\ni=1\\nf t\\ni\\ndt\\nf ×1\\n.\\n(17)\\nrt is then used as a query to create a context vector out of\\nthe left and right contexts, separately. For example, for the\\nleft context, the key vectors kl\\n1, . . . , kl\\nnl\\nf ∈Rdl\\nk and value\\nvectors vl\\n1, . . . , vl\\nnl\\nf ∈Rdl\\nv are extracted from the left context\\nfeature vectors f l\\n1, . . . , f l\\nnl\\nf ∈Rdl\\nf , similarly as before, where\\ndl\\nk and dl\\nv are the dimensions of the key and value vectors,\\nrespectively. Note that [36] proposes to use the original\\nfeature vectors as keys and values, meaning that the linear\\ntransformation consists of a multiplication by an identity\\nmatrix. Next, the scores are calculated using (18).\\nel\\ni\\n1×1 = score( rt\\ndt\\nf ×1, kl\\ni\\ndl\\nk×1).\\n(18)\\nFor the score function, [36] proposes to use an activated\\ngeneral score function [34] with a tanh activation function.\\nThe attention scores can be combined with an alignment\\nfunction and the corresponding value vectors to produce\\nthe context vector rl ∈Rdl\\nv. The alignment function used in\\n[36] takes the form of a softmax function. An analogous pro-\\ncedure can be performed to obtain the representation of the\\nright context, rr. These two context representations can then\\nbe used to create new representations of the target phrase,\\nagain, using attention. Firstly, the key vectors kt\\n1, . . . , kt\\nnt\\nf ∈\\nRdt\\nk and value vectors vt\\n1, . . . , vt\\nnt\\nf\\n∈Rdt\\nv are extracted\\nfrom the target phrase feature vectors f t\\n1, . . . , f t\\nnt\\nf ∈Rdt\\nf ,\\nsimilarly as before, using a linear transformation, where dt\\nk\\nand dt\\nv are the dimensions of the key and value vectors,\\nrespectively. Note, again, that the original feature vectors as\\nkeys and values in [36]. The attention scores for the left-\\naware target representation are then calculated using (19).\\nelt\\ni\\n1×1\\n= score( rl\\ndl\\nv×1\\n, kt\\ni\\ndt\\nk×1\\n).\\n(19)\\nThe attention scores can be combined with an alignment\\nfunction and the corresponding value vectors to produce\\nthe context vector rlt ∈Rdt\\nv. For this attention calculation,\\n[34] proposes to use the same score and alignment functions\\nas before. The right-aware target representation rrt can be\\ncalculated in a similar manner. Finally, to obtain the full\\nrepresentation vector r that is used to determine the clas-\\nsiﬁcation, the vectors rl, rr, rlt, and rrt are concatenated\\ntogether, as shown in (20).\\nr\\n(dl\\nv+dr\\nv+dt\\nv+dt\\nv)×1 = concat( rl\\ndl\\nv×1, rr\\ndr\\nv×1, rlt\\ndt\\nv×1, rrt\\ndt\\nv×1).\\n(20)\\nTo summarize, rotatory attention uses the target phrase\\nto compute new representations for the left and right context\\nusing attention, and then uses these left and right repre-\\nsentations to calculate new representations for the target\\nphrase. The ﬁrst step is designed to capture the words\\nin the left and right contexts that are most important to\\nthe target phrase. The second step is there to capture the\\nmost important information in the actual target phrase itself.\\nEssentially, the mechanism rotates attention between the\\ntarget and the contexts to improve the representations.\\nThere are many applications where combining informa-\\ntion from different inputs into a single model can be highly\\nbeneﬁcial. For example, in the ﬁeld of medical data, there\\nare often many different types of data available, such as\\nvarious scans or documents, that can provide different types\\nof information. In [37], a co-attention mechanism is used\\nfor automatic medical report generation to attend to both\\nimages and semantic tags simultaneously. Similarly, in [38],\\na co-attention model is proposed that combines general de-\\nmographics features and patient medical history features to\\npredict future health information. Additionally, an ablation\\nstudy is used in [38] to show that the co-attention part of\\nthe model speciﬁcally improves performance. A ﬁeld where\\nmulti-feature attention has been extensively explored is the\\ndomain of recommender systems. For example, in [39], a co-\\nattention network is proposed that attends to both product\\nreviews and the reviews a user has written. In [40], a model\\nis proposed for video recommendation that attends to both\\nuser features and video features. Co-attention techniques\\nhave also been used in combination with graph networks for\\nthe purpose of, for example, reading comprehension across\\nmultiple documents [41] and fake news detection [42]. In\\ncomparison to co-attention, rotatory attention has typically\\nbeen explored only in the ﬁeld of sentiment analysis, which\\nis most likely due to the speciﬁc structure of the data that\\nis necessary to use this technique. An implementation of\\nrotatory attention is proposed in [43] for sentiment analysis,\\nwhere the mechanism is extended by repeating the attention\\nrotation to iteratively further improve the representations.\\n3.1.2\\nFeature Levels\\nThe previously discussed attention mechanisms process\\ndata at a single level. We refer to these attention techniques\\nas single-level attention mechanisms. However, some data\\ntypes can be analyzed and represented on multiple levels.\\nFor example, when analyzing documents, one can analyze\\nthe document at the sentence level, word level, or even\\nthe character level. When representations or embeddings\\nof all these levels are available, one can exploit the extra\\nlevels of information. For example, one could choose to\\nperform translation based on either just the characters, or\\njust the words of the sentence. However, in [44], a technique\\nnamed attention-via-attention is introduced that allows one\\nto incorporate information from both the character, and the\\nword levels. The idea is to predict the sentence translation\\ncharacter-by-character, while also incorporating information\\nfrom a word-level attention module.\\nTo begin with, a feature model (consisting of, for ex-\\nample, word embeddings and RNNs) is used to encode\\nthe input sentence into both a character-level feature ma-\\ntrix F (c) ∈Rd(c)\\nf\\n×n(c)\\nf , and a word-level feature matrix\\nF (w) ∈Rd(w)\\nf\\n×n(w)\\nf\\n, where d(c)\\nf\\nand n(c)\\nf\\nrepresent, respec-\\ntively, the dimension of the embeddings of the characters,\\nand the number of characters, while d(w)\\nf\\nand n(w)\\nf\\nrepresent\\nthe same but at the word level. It is crucial for this method\\nthat each level in the data can be represented or embedded.\\nWhen attempting to predict a character in the translated\\n8\\nAttention\\nModuleW\\nAttention\\nModuleC\\nFig. 7. An illustration of attention-via-attention.\\nsentence, a query q(c) ∈Rdq is created by the query model\\n(like a character-level RNN), where dq is the dimension of\\nthe query vectors. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the query is used\\nto calculate attention on the word-level feature vectors F (w).\\nThis generates the context vector c(w) ∈Rd(w)\\nv\\n, where d(w)\\nv\\nrepresents the dimension of the value vectors for the word-\\nlevel attention module. This context vector summarizes\\nwhich words contain the most important information for\\npredicting the next character. If we know which words are\\nmost important, then it becomes easier to identify which\\ncharacters in the input sentence are most important. Thus,\\nthe next step is to attend to the character-level features in\\nF (c), with an additional query input: the word-level context\\nvector c(w). The actual query input for the attention model\\nwill therefore be the concatenation of the query q(c) and the\\nword context vector c(w). The output of this character-level\\nattention module is the context vector c(c). The complete\\ncontext output of the attention model is the concatenation\\nof the word-level, and character-level context vectors.\\nThe attention-via-attention technique uses representa-\\ntions for each level. However, accurate representations may\\nnot always be available for each level of the data, or it\\nmay be desirable to let the model create the representations\\nduring the process by building them from lower level repre-\\nsentations. A technique referred to as hierarchical attention\\n[5] can be used in this situation. Hierarchical attention is\\nanother technique that allows one to apply attention on\\ndifferent levels of the data. Yet, the exact mechanisms work\\nquite differently compared to attention-via-attention. The\\nidea is to start at the lowest level, and then create repre-\\nsentations, or summaries, of the next level using attention.\\nThis process is repeated till the highest level is reached. To\\nmake this a little clearer, suppose one attempts to create\\na model for document classiﬁcation, similarly to the im-\\nplementation from [5]. We analyze a document containing\\nnS sentences, with the sth sentence containing ns words,\\nfor s = 1, . . . , nS. One could use attention based on just\\nthe collection of words to classify the document. However,\\na signiﬁcant amount of important context is then left out\\nof the analysis, since the model will consider all words\\nas a single long sentence, and will therefore not consider\\nthe context within the separate sentences. Instead, one can\\nuse the hierarchical structure of a document (words form\\nsentences, and sentences form the document).\\nFig. 8 illustrates the structure of hierarchical attention.\\nFor each sentence in the document, a sentence representa-\\ntion c(s) ∈Rd(S)\\nv\\nis produced, for s = 1, . . . , nS, where d(S)\\nv\\nis the dimension of the value vectors used in the attention\\nmodel for sentence representations (Attention ModuleS in\\n\\x97(1)\\nAttention\\nModuleS\\n®(\\n)\\n\\x83o\\nAttention\\nModuleS\\nAttention\\nModuleS\\n…\\nAttention\\nModuleD\\n\\x97(2)\\n\\x97(\\n)\\n\\x83o\\n\\x94\\n®(2)\\n®(1)\\n®(`)\\nFig. 8. An illustration of hierarchical attention.\\nFig. 8). The representation is a context vector from an\\nattention module that essentially summarizes the sentence.\\nEach sentence is ﬁrst put through a feature model to extract\\nthe feature matrix F (s) ∈Rd(S)\\nf\\n×ns, for s = 1, . . . , nS, where\\nd(S)\\nf\\nrepresents the dimension of the feature vector for each\\nword, and ns represents the amount of words in sentence s.\\nFor extra clariﬁcation, the columns of F (s) are feature vec-\\ntors that correspond to the words in sentence s. As shown in\\nFig. 8, each feature matrix F (s) is used as input for an atten-\\ntion model, which produces the context vector c(s), for each\\ns = 1, . . . , nS. No queries are used in this step, so it can be\\nconsidered a self-attentive mechanism. The context vectors\\nare essentially summaries of the words in the sentences. The\\nmatrix of context vectors C = [c(1), . . . , c(nS)] ∈Rd(S)\\nv\\n×nS\\nis constructed by grouping all the obtained context vectors\\ntogether as columns. Finally, attention is calculated using C\\nas feature input, producing the representation of the entire\\ndocument in the context vector c(D) ∈Rd(D)\\nv\\n, where d(D)\\nv\\nis\\nthe dimension of the value vectors in the attention model\\nfor document representation (Attention ModuleD in Fig. 8).\\nThis context vector can be used to classify the document,\\nsince it is essentially a summary of all the sentences (and\\ntherefore also the words) in the document.\\nMulti-level models can be used in a variety of tasks.\\nFor example, in [28], hierarchical attention is used in a\\nrecommender system to model user preferences at the long-\\nterm level and the short-term level. Similarly, [45] proposes\\na hierarchical model for recommending social media images\\nbased on user preferences. Hierarchical attention has also\\nbeen successfully applied in other domains. For example,\\n[46] proposes to use hierarchical attention in a video action\\nrecognition model to capture motion information at the the\\nlong-term level and the short-term level. Furthermore, [47]\\nproposes a hierarchical attention model for cross-domain\\nsentiment classiﬁcation. In [48], a hierarchical attention\\nmodel for chatbot response generation is proposed. Lastly,\\nusing image data, [49] proposes a hierarchical attention\\nmodel for crowd counting.\\n3.1.3\\nFeature Representations\\nIn a basic attention model, a single embedding or rep-\\nresentation model is used to produce feature representa-\\ntions for the model to attend to. This is referred to as\\nsingle-representational attention. Yet, one may also opt\\nto incorporate multiple representations into the model. In\\n[50], it is argued that allowing a model access to multiple\\n9\\nembeddings can allow one to create even higher quality\\nrepresentations. Similarly, [51] incorporates multiple repre-\\nsentations of the same book (textual, syntactic, semantic,\\nvisual etc.) into the feature model. Feature representations\\nare an important part of the attention model, but attention\\ncan also be an important part of the feature model. The\\nidea is to create a new representation by taking a weighted\\naverage of multiple representations, where the weights are\\ndetermined via attention. This technique is referred to as\\nmulti-representational attention, and allows one to create\\nso-called meta-embeddings. Suppose one wants to create a\\nmeta-embedding for a word x for which E embeddings\\nx(e1), . . . , x(eE) are available. Each embedding x(ei) is of\\nsize dei, for i = 1, . . . , E. Since not all embeddings are of the\\nsame size, a transformation is performed to normalize the\\nembedding dimensions. Using embedding-speciﬁc weight\\nparameters, each embedding x(ei) is transformed into the\\nsize-normalized embedding x(ti) ∈Rdt, where dt is the size\\nof every transformed word embedding, as shown in (21).\\nx(ti)\\ndt×1 = Wei\\ndt×dei\\n× x(ei)\\ndei ×1 + bei\\ndt×1,\\n(21)\\nwhere Wei\\n∈\\nRdt×dei , and bei\\n∈\\nRdt are trainable,\\nembedding-speciﬁc weights matrices. The ﬁnal embedding\\nx(e) ∈Rdt is a weighted average of the previously calcu-\\nlated transformed representations, as shown in (22).\\nx(e)\\ndt×1 =\\nE\\nX\\ni=1\\nai\\n1×1 × x(ti)\\ndt×1 .\\n(22)\\nThe ﬁnal representation x(e) can be interpreted as the\\ncontext vector from an attention model, meaning that the\\nweights a1, . . . , aE\\n∈R1 are attention weights. Atten-\\ntion can be calculated as normally, where the columns of\\nthe features matrix F are the transformed representations\\nx(t1), . . . , x(tE). The query in this case can be ignored since\\nit is constant in all cases. Essentially, the query is “Which\\nrepresentations are the most important?” in every situation.\\nAs such, this is a self-attentive mechanism.\\nWhile\\nan\\ninteresting\\nidea,\\napplications\\nof\\nmulti-\\nrepresentational attention are limited. One example of the\\napplication of this technique is found in [52], where a multi-\\nrepresentational attention mechanism has been applied to\\ngenerate multi-lingual meta-embeddings. Another example\\nis [53], where a multi-representational text classiﬁcation\\nmodel is proposed that incorporates different representa-\\ntions of the same text. For example, the proposed model uses\\nembeddings from part-of-speech tagging, named entity rec-\\nognizers, and character-level and word-level embeddings.\\n3.2\\nGeneral Attention Mechanisms\\nThis major category consists of attention mechanisms that\\ncan be applied in any type of attention model. The structure\\nof this component can be broken down into the following\\nsub-aspects: the attention score function, the attention align-\\nment, and attention dimensionality.\\n3.2.1\\nAttention Scoring\\nThe attention score function is a crucial component in how\\nattention is calculated. Various approaches have been de-\\nveloped that each have their own advantages and disadvan-\\ntages. An overview of these functions is provided in Table 2.\\nTABLE 2\\nOverview of score function (score(q, kl)) forms.\\nName\\nFunction\\nParameters\\nAdditive\\n(Concatenate) [3]\\nwT × act(W1 × q + W2 × kl) + b)\\nw ∈Rdw\\nW1 ∈Rdw×dq\\nW2 ∈Rdw×dk\\nb ∈Rdw\\nMultiplicative\\n(Dot-Product) [4]\\nqT × kl\\n-\\nScaled Multiplicative [13]\\nqT ×kl\\n√\\ndk\\n-\\nGeneral [4]\\nkT\\nl × W × q\\nW ∈Rdk×dq\\nBiased General [54]\\nkT\\nl × (W × q + b)\\nW ∈Rdk×dq\\nb ∈Rdk\\nActivated General [34]\\nact(kT\\nl × W × q + b)\\nW ∈Rdk×dq,\\nb ∈R1\\nSimilarity [55]\\nsimilarity(q, kl)\\n-\\nEach row of Table 2 presents a possible form for the function\\nscore(q, kl), as seen in (23), where q is the query vector, and\\nkl is the lth column of K. Note that the score functions\\npresented in this section can be more efﬁciently calculated\\nin matrix form using K instead of each column separately.\\nNevertheless, the score functions are presented using kl to\\nmore clearly illustrate the relation between a key and query.\\nel\\n1×1 = score( q\\ndq×1, kl\\ndk×1).\\n(23)\\nDue to their simplicity, the most popular choices for the\\nscore function are the concatenate score function [3] and the\\nmultiplicative score function [4]. The multiplicative score\\nfunction has the advantage of being computationally inex-\\npensive due to highly optimized vector operations. How-\\never, the multiplicative function may produce non-optimal\\nresults when the dimension dk is too large [56]. When dk\\nis large, the dot-product between q and kl can grow large\\nin magnitude. To illustrate this, in [13], an example is used\\nwhere the elements of q and kl are all normally distributed\\nwith a mean equal to zero, and a variance equal to one.\\nThen, the dot-product of the vectors has a variance of dk.\\nA higher variance means a higher chance of numbers that\\nare large in magnitude. When the softmax function of the\\nalignment step is then applied using these large numbers,\\nthe gradient will become very small, meaning the model\\nwill have trouble converging [13]. To adjust for this, [13]\\nproposes to scale the multiplicative function by the factor\\n1\\n√dk , producing the scaled multiplicative score function.\\nIn [4], the multiplicative score function is extended by\\nintroducing a weights matrix W . This form, referred to\\nas the general score function, allows for an extra trans-\\nformation of kl. The biased general score function [54] is\\na further extension of the general function that introduces\\na bias weight vector b. A ﬁnal extension on this function\\nnamed the activated general score function is introduced in\\n[34], and includes the use of both a bias weight b, and an\\nactivation function act().\\nThe previously presented score functions are all based on\\ndetermining a type of similarity between the key vector and\\nthe query vector. As such, more typical similarity measures,\\nsuch as the Euclidean (L2) distance and cosine similarity,\\ncan also be implemented [55]. These scoring methods are\\nsummarized under the similarity score function which is\\nrepresented by the similarity() function.\\n10\\nThere typically is no common usage across domains\\nregarding score functions. The choice of score function for\\na particular task is most often based on empirical experi-\\nments. However, there are exceptions when, for example,\\nefﬁciency is vital. In models where this is the case, the mul-\\ntiplicative or scaled multiplicative score functions are typi-\\ncally the best choice. An example of this is the Transformer\\nmodel, which is generally computationally expensive.\\n3.2.2\\nAttention Alignment\\nThe attention alignment is the step after the attention scor-\\ning. This alignment process directly determines which parts\\nof the input data the model will attend to. The alignment\\nfunction is denoted as align() and has various forms. The\\nalign() function takes as input the previously calculated\\nattention score vector e and calculates for each element el of\\ne the attention weight al. These attention weights can then\\nbe used to create the context vector c by taking a weighted\\naverage of the value vectors v1, . . . , vnf :\\nc\\ndv×1 =\\nnf\\nX\\nl=1\\nal\\n1×1 × vl\\ndv×1.\\n(24)\\nThe most popular alignment method to calculate these\\nweights is a simple softmax function, as depicted in (25).\\nal\\n1×1 = align( el\\n1×1; e\\nnf ×1) =\\nexp(el)\\nPnf\\nj=1 exp(ej).\\n(25)\\nThis alignment method is often referred to as soft alignment\\nin computer vision settings [8], or global alignment for se-\\nquence data [4]. Nevertheless, both these terms represent the\\nsame function and can be interpreted similarly. Soft/global\\nalignment can be interpreted as the model attending to\\nall feature vectors. For example, the model attends to all\\nregions in an image, or all words in a sentence. Even though\\nthe attention model generally does focus more on speciﬁc\\nparts of the input, every part of the input will receive at least\\nsome amount of attention due to the nature of the softmax\\nfunction. Furthermore, an advantage of the softmax function\\nis that it introduces a probabilistic interpretation to the input\\nvectors. This allows one to easily analyze which parts of the\\ninput are important to the output predictions.\\nIn contrast to soft/global alignment, other methods aim\\nto achieve a more focused form of alignment. For example,\\nhard alignment [8], also known as hard attention or non-\\ndeterministic attention, is an alignment type that forces\\nthe attention model to focus on exactly one feature vector.\\nFirstly, this method implements the softmax function in the\\nexact same way as global alignment. However, the outputs\\na1, . . . , anf are not used as weights for the context vector\\ncalculation. Instead, these values are used as probabilities\\nto draw the choice of the one value vector from. A value\\nm ∈R1 is drawn from a multinomial distribution with\\na1, . . . , anf as parameters for the probabilities. Then, the\\ncontext vector is simply deﬁned as follows:\\nc\\ndv×1 = vm\\ndv×1.\\n(26)\\nHard alignment is typically more efﬁcient at inference\\ncompared to soft alignment. On the other hand, the main\\ndisadvantage of hard attention is that, due to the stochastic\\nalignment of attention, the training of the model cannot\\nbe done via the regular backpropagation method. Instead,\\nsimulation and sampling, or reinforcement learning [57]\\nare required to calculate the gradient at the hard attention\\nlayer. As such, soft/global attention is generally preferred.\\nHowever, a compromise can be made in certain situations.\\nLocal alignment [4] is a method that implements a softmax\\ndistribution, similarly to soft/global alignment. But, the\\nsoftmax distribution is calculated based only on a subset\\nof the inputs. This method is generally used in combination\\nwith sequence data. One has to specify a variable p ∈R1\\nthat determines the position of the region. Feature vectors\\nclose to p will be attended to by the model, and vectors\\ntoo far from p will be ignored. The size of the subset\\nwill be determined by the variable D ∈R1. Summarizing,\\nthe attention model will apply a softmax function on the\\nattention scores in the subset [p −D, p + D]. In other words,\\na window is placed on the input and soft/global attention\\nis calculated within that window:\\nal\\n1×1\\n= align( el\\n1×1\\n; e\\nnf ×1\\n) =\\nexp(el)\\nPp+D\\nj=p−D exp(ej)\\n.\\n(27)\\nThe question that remains is how to determine the location\\nparameter p. The ﬁrst method is referred to as monotonic\\nalignment. This straightforward method entails simply set-\\nting the location parameter equal to the location of the\\nprediction in the output sequence. Another method of deter-\\nmining the position of the region is referred to as predictive\\nalignment. As the name entails, the model attempts to\\nactually predict the location of interest in the sequence:\\np\\n1×1 = S\\n1×1 × sigmoid(wT\\np\\n1×dp\\n× tanh( Wp\\ndp×dq\\n× q\\ndq×1)),\\n(28)\\nwhere S ∈R1 is the length of the input sequence, and\\nwp ∈Rdp and Wp ∈Rdp×dq are both trainable weights\\nparameters. The sigmoid function multiplied by S makes\\nsure that p is in the range [0, S]. Additionally, in [4], it is\\nrecommended to add an additional term to the alignment\\nfunction to favor alignment around p:\\nal\\n1×1 = align( el\\n1×1; e\\nnf ×1)exp(−(l −p)2)\\n2σ2\\n),\\n(29)\\nwhere σ ∈R1 is empirically set equal to D\\n2 according to\\n[4]. Another proposed method for compromising between\\nsoft and hard alignment is reinforced alignment [58]. Sim-\\nilarly to local alignment, a subset of the feature vectors is\\ndetermined, for which soft alignment is calculated. How-\\never, instead of using a window to determine the subset,\\nreinforced alignment uses a reinforcement learning agent\\n[57], similarly to hard alignment, to choose the subset of\\nfeature vectors. The attention calculation based on these\\nchosen feature vectors is the same as regular soft alignment.\\nSoft alignment is often regarded as the standard align-\\nment function for attention models in practically every do-\\nmain. Yet, the other alignment methods have also seen inter-\\nesting uses in various domains. For example, hard attention\\nis used in [59] for the task of visual question answering.\\nIn [60], both soft and hard attention are used in a graph\\nattention model for multi-agent game abstraction. Similarly,\\nin [61], both global and local alignment are used for review\\nrating predictions. Reinforced alignment has been employed\\n11\\nin combination with a co-attention structure in [62] for the\\ntask of aspect sentiment classiﬁcation. In [63], reinforced\\nalignment is used for the task of person re-identiﬁcation\\nusing surveillance images.\\n3.2.3\\nAttention Dimensionality\\nAll previous model speciﬁcations of attention use a scalar\\nweight al for each value vector vl. This technique is referred\\nto as single-dimensional attention. However, instead of\\ndetermining a single attention score and weight for the\\nentire vector, [64] proposes to calculate weights for every\\nsingle feature in those vectors separately. This technique\\nis referred to as multi-dimensional attention, since the\\nattention weights now become higher dimensional vectors.\\nThe idea is that the model no longer has to attend to entire\\nvectors, but it can instead pick and choose speciﬁc elements\\nfrom those vectors. More speciﬁcally, attention is calculated\\nfor each dimension. As such, the model must create a vector\\nof attention weights al ∈Rdv for each value vector vl ∈Rdv.\\nThe context vector can then be calculated by summing\\nthe element-wise multiplications (◦) of the value vectors\\nv1, . . . , vnf ∈Rdv and the corresponding attention weight\\nvectors a1, . . . , anf ∈Rdv, as follows:\\nc\\ndv×1 =\\nnf\\nX\\nl=1\\nal\\ndv×1 ◦vl\\ndv×1.\\n(30)\\nHowever, since one needs to create attention weight vectors,\\nthis technique requires adjusted attention score and weight\\ncalculations. For example, the concatenate score function\\nfound in Table 2 can be adjusted by changing the w ∈Rdw\\nweights vector to the weight matrix Wd ∈Rdw×dv:\\nel\\ndv×1 = W T\\nd\\ndv×dw\\n× act( W1\\ndw×dq\\n× q\\ndq×1 + W2\\ndw×dk\\n× kl\\ndk×1 +\\nb\\ndw×1). (31)\\nThis new score function produces the attention score vectors\\ne1, . . . , enf ∈Rdv. These score vectors can be combined\\ninto a matrix of scores e = [e1, . . . , enf ] ∈Rdv×nf . To\\nproduce multi-dimensional attention weights, the alignment\\nfunction stays the same, but it is applied for each feature\\nacross the attention score columns. To illustrate, when im-\\nplementing soft attention, the attention weight produced\\nfrom the ith element of score vector el is deﬁned as follows:\\nal,i\\n1×1 = align(el,i\\n1×1;\\ne\\ndv×nf\\n) =\\nexp(el,i)\\nPnf\\nj=1 exp(ej,i),\\n(32)\\nwhere el,i represents the ith element of score vector el,\\nand al,i is the ith element of the attention weights vector\\nal. Finally, these attention weight vectors can be used to\\ncompute the context vector as presented in (30).\\nMulti-dimensional attention is a very general mecha-\\nnism that can be applied in practically every attention\\nmodel, but actual applications of the technique have been\\nrelatively sparse. One application example is [65], where\\nmulti-dimensional attention is used in a model for named\\nentity recognition based on text and visual context from\\nmultimedia posts. In [66], multi-dimensional attention is\\nused in a model for answer selection in community question\\nanswering. In [67], the U-net model for medical image seg-\\nmentation is extended with a multi-dimensional attention\\nmechanism. Similarly, in [68], the Transformer model is\\nextended with the multi-dimensional attention mechanism\\nfor the task of dialogue response generation. In [69], multi-\\ndimensional attention is used to extend graph attention\\nnetworks for dialogue state tracking. Lastly, for the task\\nof next-item recommendation, [70] proposes a model that\\nincorporates multi-dimensional attention.\\n3.3\\nQuery-Related Attention Mechanisms\\nQueries are an important part of any attention model, since\\nthey directly determine which information is extracted from\\nthe feature vectors. These queries are based on the desired\\noutput of the task model, and can be interpreted as literal\\nquestions. Some queries have speciﬁc characteristics that\\nrequire speciﬁc types of mechanisms to process them. As\\nsuch, this category encapsulates the attention mechanisms\\nthat deal with speciﬁc types of query characteristics. The\\nmechanisms in this category deal with one of the two\\nfollowing query characteristics: the type of queries or the\\nmultiplicity of queries.\\n3.3.1\\nType of Queries\\nDifferent attention models employ attention for different\\npurposes, meaning that distinct query types are necessary.\\nThere are basic queries, which are queries that are typically\\nstraightforward to deﬁne based on the data and model. For\\nexample, the hidden state for one prediction in an RNN\\nis often used as the query for the next prediction. One\\ncould also use a vector of auxiliary variables as query. For\\nexample, when doing medical image classiﬁcation, general\\npatient characteristics can be incorporated into a query.\\nSome attention mechanisms, such as co-attention, rota-\\ntory attention, and attention-over-attention, use specialized\\nqueries. For example, rotatory attention uses the context\\nvector from another attention module as query, while in-\\nteractive co-attention uses an averaged keys vector based\\non another input. Another case one can consider is when\\nattention is calculated based purely on the feature vectors.\\nThis concept has been mentioned before and is referred to\\nas self-attention or intra-attention [71]. We say that the\\nmodels use self-attentive queries. There are two ways of in-\\nterpreting such queries. Firstly, one can say that the query is\\nconstant. For example, document classiﬁcation requires only\\na single classiﬁcation as the output of the model. As such,\\nthe query is always the same, namely: “What is the class\\nof the document?”. The query can be ignored and attention\\ncan be calculated based only on the features themselves.\\nScore functions can be adjusted for this by making the query\\nvector a vector of constants or removing it entirely:\\nscore(kl\\ndk×1\\n) = wT\\n1×dw\\n× act(W\\ndw×dk\\n× kl\\ndk×1\\n+ b\\ndw×1\\n).\\n(33)\\nAdditionally, one can also interpret self-attention as learning\\nthe query along the way, meaning that the query can be\\ndeﬁned as a trainable vector of weights. For example, the\\ndot-product score function may take the following form:\\nscore(kl\\ndk×1\\n) = qT\\n1×dk\\n× kl\\ndk×1\\n,\\n(34)\\nwhere q ∈Rdk is a trainable vector of weights. One could\\nalso interpret vector b ∈Rdw as the query in (33). Another\\n12\\nuse of self-attention is to uncover the relations between\\nthe feature vectors f1, . . . , fnf . These relations can then\\nbe used as additional information to incorporate into new\\nrepresentations of the feature vectors. With basic attention\\nmechanisms, the keys matrix K, and the values matrix V\\nare extracted from the features matrix F , while the query\\nq is produced separately. For this type of self-attention, the\\nquery vectors are extracted in a similar process as the keys\\nand values, via a transformation matrix of trainable weights\\nWQ ∈Rdq×df . We deﬁne the matrix Q = [q1, . . . , qnf ] ∈\\nRdq×nf , which can be obtained as follows:\\nQ\\ndq×nf\\n= WQ\\ndq×df\\n×\\nF\\ndf ×nf\\n.\\n(35)\\nEach column of Q can be used as the query for the atten-\\ntion model. When attention is calculated using a query q, the\\nresulting context vector c will summarize the information\\nin the feature vectors that is important to the query. Since\\nthe query, or a column of Q, is now also a feature vector\\nrepresentation, the context vector contains the information\\nof all feature vectors that are important to that speciﬁc\\nfeature vector. In other words, the context vectors capture\\nthe relations between the feature vectors. For example, self-\\nattention allows one to extract the relations between words:\\nwhich verbs refer to which nouns, which pronouns refer to\\nwhich nouns, etc. For images, self-attention can be used to\\ndetermine which image regions relate to each other.\\nWhile self-attention is placed in the query-related cat-\\negory, it is also very much related to the feature model.\\nNamely, self-attention is a technique that is often used in\\nthe feature model to create improved representations of the\\nfeature vectors. For example, the Transformer model for\\nlanguage processing [13], and the Transformer model for\\nimage processing [15], both use multiple rounds of (multi-\\nhead) self-attention to improve the representation of the\\nfeature vectors. The relations captured by the self-attention\\nmechanism are incorporated into new representations. A\\nsimple method of determining such a new representation\\nis to simply set the feature vectors equal to the acquired\\nself-attention context vectors [71], as presented in (36).\\nf (new)\\ndf ×1 =\\nc\\ndf ×1,\\n(36)\\nwhere f (new) is the updated feature vector. Another possi-\\nbility is to add the context vectors to the previous feature\\nvectors with an additional normalization layer [13]:\\nf (new)\\ndf ×1 = Normalize(f (old)\\ndf ×1 +\\nc\\ndf ×1),\\n(37)\\nwhere f (old) is the previous feature vector, and Normalize()\\nis a normalization layer [72]. Using such techniques, self-\\nattention has been used to create improved word or sentence\\nembeddings that enhance model accuracy [71].\\nSelf-attention is arguably one of the more important\\ntypes of attention, partly due to its vital role in the highly\\npopular Transformer model. Self-attention is a very general\\nmechanism and can be applied to practically any problem.\\nAs such, self-attention has been extensively explored in\\nmany different ﬁelds in both Transformer-based architec-\\ntures and other types of models. For example, in [73], self-\\nattention is explored for image recognition tasks, and results\\nindicate that the technique may have substantial advantages\\nwith regards to robustness and generalization. In [74], self-\\nattention is used in a generative adversarial network (GAN)\\n[75] to determine which regions of the input image to focus\\non when generating the regions of a new image. In [76], self-\\nattention is used to design a state-of-the-art medical image\\nsegmentation model. Naturally, self-attention can also be\\nused for video processing. In [77], a self-attention model\\nis proposed for the purpose of video summarization that\\nreaches state-of-the-art results. In other ﬁelds, like audio\\nprocessing, self-attention has been explored as well. In [78],\\nself-attention is used to create a speech recognition model.\\nSelf-attention has also been explored in overlapping do-\\nmains. For example, in [79], the self-attention Transformer\\narchitecture is used to create a model that can recognize\\nphrases from audio and by lip-reading from a video. For\\nthe problem of next item recommendation, [80] proposes\\na Transformer model that explicitly captures item-item re-\\nlations using self-attention. Self-attention also has applica-\\ntions in any natural language processing ﬁelds. For example,\\nin [81], self-attention is used for sentiment analysis. Self-\\nattention is also highly popular for graph models. For\\nexample, self-attention is explored in [82] for the purpose\\nof representation learning in communication networks and\\nrating networks. Additionally, the ﬁrst attention model for\\ngraph networks was based on self-attention [83].\\n3.3.2\\nMultiplicity of Queries\\nIn previous examples, the attention model generally used\\na single query for a prediction. We say that such models\\nuse singular query attention. However, there are attention\\narchitectures that allow the model to compute attention\\nusing multiple queries. Note that this is different from, for\\nexample, an RNN that may involve multiple queries to\\nproduce a sequence of predictions. Namely, such a model\\nstill requires only a single query per prediction.\\nOne example of a technique that incorporates multiple\\nqueries is multi-head attention [13], as presented in Fig.\\n9. Multi-head attention works by implementing multiple\\nattention modules in parallel by utilizing multiple different\\nversions of the same query. The idea is to linearly transform\\nthe query q using different weight matrices. Each newly\\nformed query essentially asks for a different type of relevant\\ninformation, allowing the attention model to introduce more\\ninformation into the context vector calculation. An attention\\nmodel implements d ≥1 heads with each attention head\\nhaving its own query vector, keys matrix, and values matrix:\\nq(j), K(j) and V (j), for j = 1, . . . , d. The query q(j) is\\nobtained by linearly transforming the original query q,\\nwhile the matrices K(j) and V (j) are obtained through\\nlinear transformations of F . As such, each attention head\\nhas its own learnable weights matrices W (j)\\nq\\n, W (j)\\nK\\nand\\nW (j)\\nV\\nfor these transformations. The calculation of the query,\\nkeys, and values for the jth head are deﬁned as follows:\\nq(j)\\ndq×1 = W (j)\\nq\\ndq×dq\\n× q\\ndq×1,\\nK(j)\\ndk×nf\\n= W (j)\\nK\\ndk×df\\n×\\nF\\ndf ×nf\\n,\\nV (j)\\ndv×nf\\n= W (j)\\nV\\ndv×df\\n×\\nF\\ndf ×nf\\n.\\n(38)\\nThus, each head creates its own representations of the\\nquery q, and the input matrix F . Each head can therefore\\n13\\nAttention\\nHead1\\nAttention\\nHead2\\nAttention \\nHeadd-1\\nAttention\\nHeadd\\nFig. 9. An illustration of multi-head attention.\\nlearn to focus on different parts of the inputs, allowing\\nthe model to attend to more information. For example,\\nwhen training a machine translation model, one attention\\nhead can learn to focus on which nouns (e.g., student, car,\\napple) do certain verbs (e.g., walking, driving, buying) refer\\nto, while another attention head learns to focus on which\\nnouns refer to certain pronouns (e.g., he, she, it) [13]. Each\\nhead will also create its own vector of attention scores\\ne(j) = [e(j)\\n1 , . . . , e(j)\\nnf ] ∈Rnf , and a corresponding vector\\nof attention weights a(j) = [a(j)\\n1 , . . . , a(j)\\nnf ] ∈Rnf . As can\\nbe expected, each attention model produces its own context\\nvector c(j) ∈Rdv, as follows:\\nc(j)\\ndv×1 =\\nnf\\nX\\nl=1\\na(j)\\nl\\n1×1 × v(j)\\nl\\ndv×1.\\n(39)\\nThe goal is still to create a single context vector as output\\nof the attention model. As such, the context vectors pro-\\nduced by the individual attention heads are concatenated\\ninto a single vector. Afterwards, a linear transformation is\\napplied using the weight matrix WO ∈Rdc×dvd to make\\nsure the resulting context vector c ∈Rdc has the desired\\ndimension. This calculation is presented in (40). The dimen-\\nsion dc can be pre-speciﬁed by, for example, setting it equal\\nto dv, so that the context vector dimension is unchanged.\\nc\\ndc×1 = WO\\ndc×dvd × concat(c(1)\\ndv×1, ..., c(d)\\ndv×1).\\n(40)\\nMulti-head attention processes multiple attention mod-\\nules in parallel, but attention modules can also be imple-\\nmented sequentially to iteratively adjust the context vec-\\ntors. Each of these attention modules are referred to as\\n“repetitions” or “rounds” of attention. Such attention ar-\\nchitectures are referred to as multi-hop attention models,\\nalso known as multi-step attention models. An impor-\\ntant note to consider is the fact that multi-hop attention\\nis a mechanism that has been proposed in various forms\\nthroughout various works. While the mechanism always\\ninvolves multiple rounds of attention, the multi-hop im-\\nplementation proposed in [84] differs from the mechanism\\nproposed in [85] or [86]. Another interesting example is\\n[87], where a “multi-hop” attention model is proposed that\\nwould actually be considered alternating co-attention in this\\nsurvey, as explained in Subsection 3.1.1.\\nWe present a general form of multi-hop attention that\\nis largely a generalization of the techniques introduced in\\n[85] and [88]. Fig. 10 provides an example implementation\\nof a multi-hop attention mechanism. The general idea is\\nto iteratively transform the query, and use the query to\\ntransform the context vector, such that the model can extract\\ndifferent information in each step. Remember that a query\\nAttention\\nModule\\nAttention\\nModule\\nQuery\\nModel\\nQuery\\nModel\\nAttention\\nModule\\nQuery\\nModel\\nFig. 10. An example illustration of multi-hop attention. Solid arrows\\nrepresent the base multi-hop model structure, while dotted arrows rep-\\nresent optional connections.\\nis similar to a literal question. As such, one can interpret\\nthe transformed queries as asking the same question in a\\ndifferent manner or from a different perspective, similarly\\nto the queries in multi-head attention. The query that was\\npreviously denoted by q is now referred to as the initial\\nquery, and is denoted by q(0). At hop s, the current query\\nq(s) is transformed into a new query representation q(s+1),\\npossibly using the current context vector c(s) as another\\ninput, and some transformation function transform():\\nq(s+1)\\ndq×1\\n= transform(q(s)\\ndq×1\\n, c(s)\\ndv×1\\n).\\n(41)\\nFor the\\nspeciﬁc form of\\nthe transformation function\\ntransform(), [85] proposes to use a mechanism similar to\\nself-attention. Essentially, the queries used by the question\\nanswer matching model proposed in [85] were originally\\nbased on a set of feature vectors extracted from a question.\\n[85] also deﬁnes the original query q(0) as the unweighted\\naverage of these feature vectors. At each hop s, attention\\ncan be calculated on these feature vectors using the previous\\nquery q(s) as the query in this process. The resulting context\\nvector of this calculation is the next query vector. Using\\nthe context vector c(s) instead of q(s) as the query for this\\nprocess is also a possibility, which is similar to the LCR-\\nRot-hop model proposed in [43] and the multi-step model\\nproposed in [88]. Such a connection is represented by the\\ndotted arrows in Fig. 10. The transformation mechanism\\nuses either the q(s) or the context vector c(s) as query, but a\\ncombination via concatenation is also possible.\\nEach query representation is used as input for the at-\\ntention module to compute attention on the columns of the\\nfeature matrix F , as seen previously. One main difference,\\nhowever, is that the context vector c(s) is also used as input,\\nso that the actual query input for the attention model is\\nthe concatenation of c(s) and q(s+1). The adjusted attention\\nscore function is presented in (42). Note that the initial\\ncontext vector c(0) is predeﬁned. One way of doing this is\\nby setting it equal to the unweighted average of the value\\nvectors v1, . . . , vnf ∈Rdv extracted from F .\\ne(s)\\nl\\n1×1 = score(concat(q(s+1)\\ndq×1 , c(s)\\ndv×1), kl\\ndk×1).\\n(42)\\nAn alignment function and the value vectors are then used\\nto produce the next context vector c(s+1). One must note\\nthat in [85], the weights used in each iteration are the same\\nweights, meaning that the number of parameters do not\\nscale with the number of repetitions. Yet, using multiple\\nhops with different weight matrices can also be viable, as\\nshown by the Transformer model [13] and in [88]. It may be\\n14\\ndifﬁcult to grasp why c(s) is part of the query input for the\\nattention model. Essentially, this technique is closely related\\nto self-attention in the sense that, in each iteration, a new\\ncontext representation is created from the feature vectors\\nand the context vector. The essence of this mechanism is\\nthat one wants to iteratively alter the query and the context\\nvector, while attending to the feature vectors. In the process,\\nthe new representations of the context vector absorb more\\ndifferent kinds of information. This is also the main differ-\\nence between this type of attention and multi-head atten-\\ntion. Multi-head attention creates multiple context vectors\\nfrom multiple queries and combines them to create a ﬁnal\\ncontext vector as output. Multi-hop attention iteratively\\nreﬁnes the context vector by incorporating information from\\nthe different queries. This does have the disadvantage of\\nhaving to calculate attention sequentially.\\nInterestingly, due to the variations in which multi-hop\\nattention has been proposed, some consider the Transformer\\nmodel’s encoder and decoder to consist of several single-\\nhop attention mechanisms [84] instead of being a multi-\\nhop model. However, in the context of this survey, we\\nconsider the Transformer model to be an alternative form\\nof the multi-hop mechanism, as the features matrix F is not\\ndirectly reused in each step. Instead, F is only used as an\\ninput for the ﬁrst hop, and is transformed via self-attention\\ninto a new representation. The self-attention mechanism\\nuses each feature vector in F as a query, resulting in a matrix\\nof context vectors as output of each attention hop. The\\nintermediate context vectors are turned into matrices and\\nrepresent iterative transformations of the matrix F , which\\nare used in the consecutive steps. Thus, the Transformer\\nmodel iteratively reﬁnes the features matrix F by extracting\\nand incorporating new information.\\nWhen dealing with a classiﬁcation task, another idea is\\nto use a different query for each class. This is the basic\\nprinciple behind capsule-based attention [89], as inspired\\nby the capsule networks [90]. Suppose we have the feature\\nvectors f1, . . . , fnf ∈Rdf , and suppose there are are dy\\nclasses that the model can predict. Then, a capsule-based\\nattention model deﬁnes a capsule for each of the dy classes\\nthat each take as input the feature vectors. Each capsule\\nconsists of, in order, an attention module, a probability\\nmodule, and a reconstruction module, which are depicted in\\nFig. 11. The attention modules all use self-attentive queries,\\nso each module learns its own query: ”Which feature vectors\\nare important to identify this class?”. In [89], a self-attentive\\nmultiplicative score function is used for this purpose:\\nec,l\\n1×1\\n= qT\\nc\\n1×dk\\n× kl\\ndk×1\\n,\\n(43)\\nwhere ec,l ∈R1 is the attention score for vector l in capsule\\nc, and qc ∈Rdk is a trainable query for capsule c, for\\nc = 1, . . . , dy. Each attention module then uses an alignment\\nfunction, and uses the produced attention weights to deter-\\nmine a context vector cc ∈Rdv. Next, the context vector\\ncc is fed through a probability layer consisting of a linear\\ntransformation with a sigmoid activation function:\\npc\\n1×1\\n= sigmoid(wT\\nc\\n1×dv\\n× cc\\ndv×1\\n+ bc\\n1×1\\n),\\n(44)\\n\\x97\\nAttention\\nModule1\\nAttention\\nModule2\\nAttention\\xa0\\nModuledy-1\\nAttention\\nModuledy\\n…\\n®z\\x8e\\n®\\n−1\\nz\\x8e\\n®2\\n®1\\nProbability\\nModule1\\nProbability\\nModule2\\nProbability\\nModuledy-1\\nProbability\\nModuledy\\nReconstruction\\nModule1\\nReconstruction\\nModule2\\n\\x851\\n½1\\n½2\\n\\x852\\nReconstruction\\nModuledy-1\\n½\\n−1\\nz\\x8e\\n\\x85\\n−1\\nz\\x8e\\nReconstruction\\nModuledy\\n½z\\x8e\\n\\x85z\\x8e\\nFig. 11.

The ﬁnal layer is the recon-\\nstruction module that creates a class vector representation.\\nThis representation rc ∈Rdv is determined by simply\\nmultiplying the context vector cc by the probability pc:\\nrc\\ndv×1\\n= pc\\n1×1\\n× cc\\ndv×1\\n.\\n(45)\\nThe capsule representation is used when training the model.\\nFirst of all, the model is trained to predict the probabilities\\np1, . . . , pdy as accurately as possible compared to the true\\nvalues. Secondly, via a joint loss function, the model is also\\ntrained to accurately construct the capsule representations\\nr1, . . . , rdy. A features representation f ∈Rdf is deﬁned\\nwhich is simply the unweighted average of the original fea-\\nture vectors. The idea is to train the model such that vector\\nrepresentations from capsules that are not the correct class\\ndiffer signiﬁcantly from f while the representation from the\\ncorrect capsule is very similar to f. A dot-product between\\nthe capsule representations and the features representation\\nis used in [89] as a measure of the distance between the vec-\\ntors. Note that dv must equal df in this case, otherwise the\\nvectors would have incompatible dimensions. Interestingly,\\nsince attention is calculated for each class individually, one\\ncan track which speciﬁc feature vectors are important for\\nwhich speciﬁc class. In [89], this idea is used to discover\\nwhich words correspond to which sentiment class.\\nThe number of tasks that can make use of multiple\\nqueries is substantial, due to how general the mechanisms\\nare. As such, the techniques described in this section have\\nbeen extensively explored in various domains. For exam-\\nple, multi-head attention has been used for speaker recog-\\nnition based on audio spectrograms [91]. In [92], multi-\\nhead attention is used for recommendation of news arti-\\ncles. Additionally, multi-head attention can be beneﬁcial\\nfor graph attention models as well [83]. As for multi-hop\\nattention, quite a few papers have been mentioned before,\\nbut there are still many other interesting examples. For\\nexample, in [93], a multi-hop attention model is proposed\\nfor medication recommendation. Furthermore, practically\\nevery Transformer model makes use of both multi-head\\nand multi-hop attention. The Transformer model has been\\nextensively explored in various domains. For example, in\\n[94], a Transformer model is implemented for image cap-\\n15\\ntioning. In [95], Transformers are explored for medical im-\\nage segmentation. In [96], a Transformer model is used for\\nemotion recognition in text messages. A last example of\\nan application of Transformers is [17], which proposes a\\nTransformer model for recommender systems. In compari-\\nson with multi-head and multi-hop attention, capsule-based\\nattention is arguably the least popular of the mechanisms\\ndiscussed for the multiplicity of queries. One example is\\n[97], where an attention-based capsule network is proposed\\nthat also includes a multi-hop attention mechanism for the\\npurpose of visual question answering. Another example is\\n[98], where capsule-based attention is used for aspect-level\\nsentiment analysis of restaurant reviews.\\nThe multiplicity of queries is a particularly interesting\\ncategory due to the Transformer model [13], which com-\\nbines a form of multi-hop and multi-head attention. Due\\nto the initial success of the Transformer model, many im-\\nprovements and iterations of the model have been produced\\nthat typically aim to improve the predictive performance,\\nthe computational efﬁciency, or both. For example, the\\nTransformer-XL [99] is an extension of the original Trans-\\nformer that uses a recurrence mechanism to not be limited\\nby a context window when processing the outputs. This\\nallows the model to learn signiﬁcantly longer dependencies\\nwhile also being computationally more efﬁcient during the\\nevaluation phase. Another extension of the Transformer is\\nknown as the Reformer model [100]. This model is signiﬁ-\\ncantly more efﬁcient computationally, by means of locality-\\nsensitive hashing, and memory-wise, by means of reversible\\nresidual layers. Such computational improvements are vital,\\nsince one of the main disadvantages of the Transformer\\nmodel is the sheer computational cost due to the complexity\\nof the model scaling quadratically with the amount of input\\nfeature vectors. The Linformer model [101] manages to\\nreduce the complexity of the model to scale linearly, while\\nachieving similar performance as the Transformer model.\\nThis is achieved by approximating the attention weights\\nusing a low-rank matrix. The Lite-Transformer model pro-\\nposed in [102] achieves similar results by implementing\\ntwo branches within the Transformer block that specialize\\nin capturing global and local information. Another inter-\\nesting Transformer architecture is the Synthesizer [103].\\nThis model replaces the pairwise self-attention mechanism\\nwith “synthetic” attention weights. Interestingly, the per-\\nformance of this model is relatively close to the original\\nTransformer, meaning that the necessity of the pairwise\\nself-attention mechanism of the Transformer model may\\nbe questionable. For a more comprehensive overview of\\nTransformer architectures, we refer to [104].\\n4\\nEVALUATION OF ATTENTION MODELS\\nIn this section, we present various types of evaluation for\\nattention models. Firstly, one can evaluate the structure of\\nattention models using the taxonomy presented in Section 3.\\nFor such an analysis, we consider the attention mechanism\\ncategories (see Fig. 3) as orthogonal dimensions of a model.\\nThe structure of a model can be analyzed by determining\\nwhich mechanism a model uses for each category. Table 3\\nprovides an overview of attention models found in the liter-\\nature with a corresponding analysis based on the attention\\nmechanisms the models implement.\\nSecondly, we discuss various techniques for evaluating\\nthe performance of attention models. The performance of at-\\ntention models can be evaluated using extrinsic or intrinsic\\nperformance measures, which are discussed in Subsections\\n4.1 and 4.2, respectively.\\n4.1\\nExtrinsic Evaluation\\nIn general, the performance of an attention model is mea-\\nsured using extrinsic performance measures. For example,\\nperformance measures typically used in the ﬁeld of natural\\nlanguage processing are the BLEU [107], METEOR [108],\\nand Perplexity [109] metrics. In the ﬁeld of audio processing,\\nthe Word Error Rate [110] and Phoneme Error Rate [111] are\\ngenerally employed. For general classiﬁcation tasks, error\\nrates, precision, and recall are generally used. For computer\\nvision tasks, the PSNR [112], SSIM [113], or IoU [114] metrics\\nare used. Using these performance measures, an attention\\nmodel can either be compared to other state-of-the-art mod-\\nels, or an ablation study can be performed. If possible, the\\nimportance of the attention mechanism can be tested by\\nreplacing it with another mechanism and observing whether\\nthe overall performance of the model decreases [105], [115].\\nAn example of this is replacing the weighted average used\\nto produce the context vector with a simple unweighted\\naverage and observing whether there is a decrease in over-\\nall model performance [35]. This ablation method can be\\nused to evaluate whether the attention weights can actually\\ndistinguish important from irrelevant information.\\n4.2\\nIntrinsic Evaluation\\nAttention models can also be evaluated using attention-\\nspeciﬁc intrinsic performance measures. In [4], the at-\\ntention weights are formally evaluated via the Alignment\\nError Rate (AER) to measure the accuracy of the attention\\nweights with respect to annotated attention vectors. [116]\\nincorporates this idea into an attention model by supervis-\\ning the attention mechanism using gold attention vectors.\\nA joint loss function consisting of the regular task-speciﬁc\\nloss and the attention weights loss function is constructed\\nfor this purpose. The gold attention vectors are based on\\nannotated text data sets where keywords are hand-labelled.\\nHowever, since attention is inspired by human attention,\\none could evaluate attention models by comparing them to\\nthe attention behaviour of humans.\\n4.2.1\\nEvaluation via Human Attention\\nIn [117], the concept of attention correctness is proposed,\\nwhich is a quantitative intrinsic performance metric that\\nevaluates the quality of the attention mechanism based on\\nactual human attention behaviour. Firstly, the calculation\\nof this metric requires data that includes the attention be-\\nhaviour of a human. For example, a data set containing im-\\nages with the corresponding regions that a human focuses\\non when performing a certain task, such as image caption-\\ning. The collection of regions focused on by the human is\\nreferred to as the ground truth region. Suppose an attention\\nmodel attends to the nf feature vectors f1, . . . , fnf ∈Rdf .\\nFeature vector fi corresponds to region Ri of the given\\n16\\nTABLE 3\\nAttention models analyzed based on the proposed taxonomy. A plus sign (+) between two mechanisms indicates that both techniques were\\ncombined in the same model, while a comma (,) indicates that both mechanisms were tested in the same paper, but not necessarily as a\\ncombination in the same model.\\nFeature-Related\\nGeneral\\nQuery-Related\\nMultiplicity\\nLevels\\nRepresentations\\nScoring\\nAlignment\\nDimensionality\\nType\\nMultiplicity\\nBahdanau et al.

We deﬁne the set G as the set\\nof regions that belong to the ground truth region, such that\\nRi ∈G if Ri is part of the ground truth region. The attention\\nmodel calculates the attention weights a1, . . . , anf ∈R1 via\\nthe usual attention process. The Attention Correctness (AC)\\nmetric can then be calculated using (46).\\nAC\\n1×1 =\\nX\\ni:Ri∈G\\nai\\n1×1.\\n(46)\\nThus, this metric is equal to the sum of the attention weights\\nfor the ground truth regions. Since the attention weights\\nsum up to 1 due to, for example, a softmax alignment\\nfunction, the AC value will be a value between 0 and 1.\\nIf the model attends to only the ground truth regions, then\\nAC is equal to 1, and if the attention model does not attend\\nto any of the ground truth regions, AC will be equal to 0.\\nIn [118], a rank correlation metric is used to compare\\nthe generated attention weights to the attention behaviour\\nof humans. The conclusion of this work is that attention\\nmaps generated by standard attention models generally do\\nnot correspond to human attention. Attention models often\\nfocus on much larger regions or multiple small non-adjacent\\nregions. As such, a technique to improve attention models is\\nto allow the model to learn from human attention patterns\\nvia a joint loss of the regular loss function and an attention\\nweight loss function based on the human gaze behaviour,\\nsimilarly to how annotated attention vectors are used in\\n[116] to supervise the attention mechanism. [117] proposes\\nto use human attention data to supervise the attention\\nmechanism in such a manner. Similarly, a state-of-the-art\\nvideo captioning model is proposed in [119] that learns from\\nhuman gaze data to improve the attention mechanism.\\n4.2.2\\nManual Evaluation\\nA method that is often used to evaluate attention models is\\nthe manual inspection of attention weights. As previously\\nmentioned, the attention weights are a direct indication of\\nwhich parts of the data the attention model ﬁnds most\\nimportant. Therefore, observing which parts of the inputs\\nthe model focuses on can be helpful in determining if the\\nmodel is behaving correctly. This allows for some interpre-\\ntation of the behaviour of models that are typically known\\nto be black boxes. However, rather than checking if the\\nmodel focuses on the most important parts of the data, some\\nuse the attention weights to determine which parts of the\\ndata are most important. This would imply that attention\\nmodels provide a type of explanation, which is a subject\\nof contention among researchers. Particularly, in [120], ex-\\ntensive experiments are conducted for various natural lan-\\nguage processing tasks to investigate the relation between\\nattention weights and important information to determine\\nwhether attention can actually provide meaningful expla-\\nnations. In this paper titled “Attention is not Explanation”,\\nit is found that attention weights do not tend to correlate\\nwith important features. Additionally, the authors are able\\nto replace the produced attention weights with completely\\ndifferent values while keeping the model output the same.\\nThese so-called “adversarial” attention distributions show\\nthat an attention model may focus on completely different\\ninformation and still come to the same conclusions, which\\nmakes interpretation difﬁcult. Yet, in another paper titled\\n“Attention is not not Explanation” [121], the claim that\\nattention is not explanation is questioned by challenging\\nthe assumptions of the previous work. It is found that\\nthe adversarial attention distributions do not perform as\\nreliably well as the learned attention weights, indicating that\\nit was not proved that attention is not viable for explanation.\\nIn general, the conclusion regarding the interpretability\\nof attention models is that researchers must be extremely\\ncareful when drawing conclusions based on attention pat-\\nterns. For example, problems with an attention model can be\\ndiagnosed via the attention weights if the model is found to\\nfocus on the incorrect parts of the data, if such information\\nis available. Yet, conversely, attention weights may only be\\nused to obtain plausible explanations for why certain parts\\nof the data are focused on, rather than concluding that those\\n17\\nparts are signiﬁcant to the problem [121]. However, one\\nshould still be cautious as the viability of such approaches\\ncan depend on the model architecture [122].\\n5\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this survey, we have provided an overview of recent\\nresearch on attention models in deep learning. Attention\\nmechanisms have been a prominent development for deep\\nlearning models as they have shown to improve model per-\\nformance signiﬁcantly, producing state-of-the-art results for\\nvarious tasks in several ﬁelds of research. We have presented\\na comprehensive taxonomy that can be used to categorize\\nand explain the diverse number of attention mechanisms\\nproposed in the literature. The organization of the taxonomy\\nwas motivated based on the structure of a task model that\\nconsists of a feature model, an attention model, a query\\nmodel, and an output model. Furthermore, the attention\\nmechanisms have been discussed using a framework based\\non queries, keys, and values. Last, we have shown how\\none can use extrinsic and intrinsic measures to evaluate the\\nperformance of attention models, and how one can use the\\ntaxonomy to analyze the structure of attention models.\\nThe attention mechanism is typically relatively simple\\nto understand and implement and can lead to signiﬁcant\\nimprovements in performance. As such, it is no surprise that\\nthis is a highly active ﬁeld of research with new attention\\nmechanisms and models being developed constantly. Not\\nonly are new mechanisms consistently being developed,\\nbut there is also still ample opportunity for the exploration\\nof existing mechanisms for new tasks. For example, multi-\\ndimensional attention [64] is a technique that shows promis-\\ning results and is general enough to be implemented in\\nalmost any attention model. However, it has not seen much\\napplication in current works. Similarly, multi-head atten-\\ntion [13] is a technique that can be efﬁciently parallelized\\nand implemented in practically any attention model. Yet,\\nit is mostly seen only in Transformer-based architectures.\\nLastly, similarly to how [43] combines rotatory attention\\nwith multi-hop attention, combining multi-dimensional at-\\ntention, multi-head attention, capsule-based attention, or\\nany of the other mechanisms presented in this survey may\\nproduce new state-of-the-art results for the various ﬁelds of\\nresearch mentioned in this survey.\\nThis survey has mainly focused on attention mech-\\nanisms for supervised models, since these comprise the\\nlargest proportion of the attention models in the literature.\\nIn comparison to the total amount of research that has been\\ndone on attention models, research on attention models\\nfor semi-supervised learning [123], [124] or unsupervised\\nlearning [125], [126] has received limited attention and has\\nonly become active recently. Attention may play a more\\nsigniﬁcant role for such tasks in the future as obtaining\\nlarge amounts of labeled data is a difﬁcult task. Yet, as\\nlarger and more detailed data sets become available, the\\nresearch on attention models can advance even further. For\\nexample, we mentioned the fact that attention weights can\\nbe trained directly based on hand-annotated data [116] or\\nactual human attention behaviour [117], [119]. As new data\\nsets are released, future research may focus on developing\\nattention models that can incorporate those types of data.\\nWhile attention is intuitively easy to understand, there\\nstill is a substantial lack of theoretical support for attention.\\nAs such, we expect more theoretical studies to additionally\\ncontribute to the understanding of the attention mecha-\\nnisms in complex deep learning systems. Nevertheless, the\\npractical advantages of attention models are clear. Since\\nattention models provide signiﬁcant performance improve-\\nments in a variety of ﬁelds, and as there are ample opportu-\\nnities for more advancements, we foresee that these models\\nwill still receive signiﬁcant attention in the time to come.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]\\nH.

Furthermore,\\nwe empirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority of\\ndaGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\\nneural machine translation.\\n1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nThe Transformer model, as introduced by (Vaswani, 2017), has emerged as a pivotal architecture\\ndriving the advancement of contemporary deep learning models across various domains, including\\nnatural language processing (Brown et al., 2020), audio signal processing (Gulati et al., 2020), and\\nimage processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Central to the Transformer’s success is the attention\\nmechanism, which facilitates the contextualization of input token representations. Based on the\\nsimilarities of query and key vectors, the attention mechanism mixes value vectors as follows (a\\nsingle scaled dot-product self-attention head (Vaswani, 2017)):\\nY = PXV ,\\n(1)\\nPij =\\nexp(Aij)\\nPT\\nk=1 exp(Aik)\\n,\\n(2)\\nA =\\n\\x10p\\ndqk\\n\\x11−1\\nXQX⊤\\nK,\\n(3)\\nwhere XQ = XWQ, XK = XWK, and XV = XWV . X ∈RT ×d is input representations with\\nT sequence length and d dimensionality, and WQ, WK ∈Rd×dqk, and WV ∈Rd×dv are weight\\nmatrices.\\nDespite its empirical success, the conventional attention mechanism, particularly the self-attention\\nmechanism, has been shown to exhibit two significant limitations. The first issue is the phenomenon\\nknown as the rank-collapse problem (Dong et al., 2021), where output token representations become\\nsimilar to others, leading to a loss of rank as they progress through each layer. While a controlled\\n1\\narXiv:2410.15578v1  [cs.LG]  21 Oct 2024\\nArxiv preprint version\\nFigure 1: Examples of convex and\\naffine combinations Yc and Ya,\\ngiven X value representations.\\nFigure 2: Our proposed daGPAM structure in an example\\nof two multi-head self-attention in Transformer.\\ndegree of rank-reduction can be beneficial for eliminating redundant information (Tishby & Za-\\nslavsky, 2015), excessive rank-reduction risks the loss of critical information. Previous studies have\\nextensively documented the self-attention layer’s tendency for intensive rank-reduction (Dong et al.,\\n2021; Noci et al., 2022; 2024). The second issue is the gradient vanishing problem (Richter & Wat-\\ntenhofer, 2022; Wang et al., 2021). During the softmax-based normalization step, the gradient is\\nconsistently less than 1 and saturates close to 0, thereby impeding upper attention layers’ sufficient\\nflow of gradients to the lower layers. Moreover, in this paper, we demonstrate that these two issues\\nare inherently challenging to address both simultaneously.\\nPrevious approaches to addressing the rank-collapse problem in Transformers have primarily fo-\\ncused on preserving input token representations. One strategy amplifies the coefficient of the short-\\ncut branch in the residual connection (Noci et al., 2022), while another reduces the contextualization\\neffect by regularizing the attention matrix, P, to be similar to an identity matrix (He et al., 2023;\\nNoci et al., 2024). However, these methods can diminish the attention layer’s ability to capture\\nmeaningful contextual information (Veit et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2022). To address the gradient\\nvanishing problem, alternative attention mechanisms have been proposed to replace the conven-\\ntional softmax-based mechanism, Eqs.2 and 3 (Richter & Wattenhofer, 2022; Wang et al., 2021).\\nDespite their theoretical effects for improving gradient flow, these alternative mechanisms have not\\ndemonstrated practical advantages in benchmark experiments.\\nIn contrast to prior approaches, we posit that the underlying issues stem from the convex combi-\\nnation structure in the conventional attention mechanism. The normalized attention scores, Pij, as\\ndefined in Eq.2, are non-negative and sum to 1 along the query axis, making the conventional atten-\\ntion mechanism a valid convex combination of input representations. Consequently, as illustrated\\nin Fig.1, the output representations, Yc, are constrained within the convex hull (yellow plane) of\\nthe input value representations. This fundamental constraint limits the diversity of output represen-\\ntations, causing them to become more similar to one another than the input value representations,\\nthereby intensifying the rank-collapse problem.\\nThis consideration naturally raised the question: how about making it an affine combination? The\\naffine combination is a generalization of the convex combination, allowing the normalized attention\\nscores to take negative values while still maintaining a total sum to be 1. As depicted in Fig.1,\\nthe output representations, Ya, are no longer constrained to lie within the convex hull, but instead\\nwithin the affine hull (green plane), thereby removing the fundamental constraint that can lead to\\nrank-collapse. However, from a probabilistic perspective, the notion of negative normalized atten-\\ntion scores may seem unconventional, since negative probability is unfamiliar concept. Nevertheless,\\nthe discussions by prominent physicists, such as P. Dirac (Dirac, 1942) and R. Feynman (Feynman,\\n1984), have concretized the concept of negative probability by generalizing the Kolmogorov’s prob-\\nability conditions as follows:\\nKolmogorov’s Probability Conditions.. (1) P(e) ≥0, and (2) P\\ne∈Ω\\nP(e) = 1 where P(e) ∈R is\\nthe probability measure of event e and Ωis event space.1\\n1For simplicity, we mention only the two main conditions.\\n2\\nArxiv preprint version\\nGeneralized Probability Conditions (Sz´ekely, 2005). (1) P\\ne∈Ω\\n|P(e)| < ∞, and (2) P\\ne∈Ω\\nP(e) = 1\\nwhere P(e) ∈R is the probability measure of event e and Ωis event space.\\nIt is important to note that the first condition of generalized probability allows for the possibility of\\nnegative probabilities. Building on this long-standing line of research, we introduce the attention\\nmechanism based on the affine (or scaled-affine) combination, which we refer to as the generalized\\nprobabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM). As a generalized framework, GPAM encompasses the\\nconventional attention mechanism as a special case where all attention values are non-negative.\\nIn this paper, we explore GPAM in the Transformer architecture, and as a cornerstone design of\\nGPAM, we propose a dual-attention design that facilitates GPAM with adding only a negligible\\nnumber of parameters. Specifically, we add an additional attention matrix computation to the orig-\\ninal scaled dot-product self-(or cross-) attention mechanism with a small additional weight matrix\\nwhich increases less than 1% of total parameters on average. Then, the resulting two attention matri-\\nces are treated as positive and negative parts of the final attention score, respectively. By combining\\nthese two attention scores with pre-defined or trainable scalar weights, we ensure that our proposed\\ndual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) a valid affine (or scaled-affine) combination. Fig.2 illustrates the\\nstructure of this design. When we propose a GPAM method, we show theoretically that our method\\nis advantageous for mitigating not only the rank-collapse problem, but also the gradient vanishing\\nproblem. Our empirical validations give evidences for the above theories in various aspects. In\\naddition, we experimentally demonstrate and explain the superiority of daGPAM compared to other\\nalternative attention mechanisms that was proposed to address the mentioned problems. Finally, we\\ndemonstrate the benefits of daGPAM in benchmark experiments in tasks such as language modeling\\n(LM) and neural machine translation (NMT).\\n2\\nRELATED WORKS\\n2.1\\nRANK-COLLAPSE PROBLEM IN TRANSFORMER\\nRecent studies have analyzed the occurrence and practical risks of the rank-collapse problem in\\nTransformers (Dong et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2022; Noci et al., 2022; He et al., 2023; Noci et al.,\\n2024). The rank-collapse phenomenon refers to the tendency of token representations to become\\nincreasingly similar to one another as they are processed through successive layers. The first theo-\\nretical exploration of this issue demonstrated that the pure attention layer, as described by Eqs.1∼3,\\nreduces the ‘residual’ at an exponential rate with increasing layer depth. The residual metric quan-\\ntifies how close token representations are to their mean point in terms of Euclidean distance, and is\\nformally defined as follows:\\nres(X) = X −1¯x⊤∈RT ×d, where ¯x = arg min\\nx\\n∥X −1x⊤∥.\\n(4)\\nThen, the relationship of input/output residual is derived as follows:\\nLemma 1 (Dong et al. (2021), Simplified). For any single scaled dot-product self-attention layer\\nwith a term γ that depends on the attention entries, the composite norm of output residual is bounded\\nby\\n∥res(Y)∥1,∞≤4\\n√\\n2γ∥WQK∥1∥WV ∥1,∞\\np\\ndqk\\n∥res(X)∥3\\n1,∞,\\n(5)\\nwhere WQK = WQW⊤\\nK. In the region that holds 4\\n√\\n2γ∥WQK∥1∥WV ∥1,∞<\\np\\ndqk, the output\\nresidual norm is diminished compared to the cubic rate of input residual norm.\\nBuilding on this lemma and extending it to multi-layer cases, prior research has argued for the\\nexistence of the rank-collapse problem and empirically demonstrated that a substantial region of the\\nparameter space that falls into rank-collapse issue (Dong et al., 2021). For a complete description\\nof the lemma, please refer to Appendix A.1.1, and read the original paper for the proof. In addition\\nto the rank-collapse problem, related concepts such as attention collapse, over-smoothing, over-\\ncorrelation, and dimensional collapse have been identified in various domains, including vision\\nTransformers (Zhou et al., 2021; Tang et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), contrastive\\n3\\nArxiv preprint version\\nlearning (Jing et al., 2021; Hua et al., 2021), graph neural networks (Li et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2022;\\nGuo et al., 2023; Roth & Liebig, 2024), and general neural networks (Feng et al., 2022; Jacot, 2023).\\nPrevious studies have attempted to address the rank-collapse problem through various strategies,\\nsuch as strengthening the shortcut branch (Tang et al., 2021; Noci et al., 2022), regularizing the at-\\ntention matrix to be similar to an identity matrix (He et al., 2023; Noci et al., 2024), and regularizing\\nto preserve local information (Yan et al., 2022). However, these approaches may weaken the contex-\\ntualization effect of the attention layer. Alternative methods have proposed various sequence-wise\\nnormalization techniques aimed at explicitly diversifying token representations (Hua et al., 2021;\\nGuo et al., 2023). However, these techniques may be unsuitable for short sentences and autore-\\ngressive architectures due to their reliance on inadequate statistic across sequences. In contrast to\\nthese approaches, our GPAM develops the attention layer using a novel methodology grounded in\\nthe principles of convex and affine combinations.\\n2.2\\nGRADIENT VANISHING PROBLEM IN TRANSFORMER\\nSeveral previous studies have identified the gradient vanishing problem within the Transformer ar-\\nchitecture (Zhang et al., 2019; Richter & Wattenhofer, 2022; Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021).\\nA primary contributor to this issue is the gradients of the softmax function, as represented in Eq.2,\\nwhich consistently yield gradient values less than 1. The following lemma derives these gradients.\\nLemma 2 (Gradient Vanishing in Attention Mechanism). The gradient that the input unnormalized\\nattention score, Eq.3, receives through the normalized attention score, Eq.2, (without 1/\\np\\ndqk) is\\nderived as follows:\\n∂Pij\\n∂Aij\\n= Pij(1 −Pij),\\n∂Pik,k̸=j\\n∂Aij\\n= −PikPij,\\n(6)\\nThe maximum magnitude of each gradient is 0.25 when Pij = 0.5 for the first, and Pij = 0.5 and\\nPik = 0.5 for the last.\\nPrevious research has demonstrated that there exists a significant saturation range of Aij values,\\nleading to the gradients in Eq.6 approaching close to 0 (Richter & Wattenhofer, 2022).\\nPrevious studies have sought to address the gradient vanishing problem by proposing various forms\\nof unnormalized attention scores, including non-exponentiated raw scores (Richter & Wattenhofer,\\n2022) and scores transformed by periodic functions (Wang et al., 2021). Additionally, some ap-\\nproaches have eliminated the normalization step entirely to ensure that the gradient remains equal\\nto 1 (Richter & Wattenhofer, 2022). While these approaches are theoretically effective in mitigat-\\ning the gradient vanishing issue, they have not demonstrated practical advantages in benchmark\\nexperiments.\\n2.3\\nALTERNATIVE ATTENTION MECHANISMS\\nAmong the previous studies that have proposed alternative attention mechanisms comparable to our\\nGPAM (Wang et al., 2021; Richter & Wattenhofer, 2022; He et al., 2023; Noci et al., 2024), some\\nmethods unintentionally permit negative attention scores, similar to our approach. Additionally,\\nthere is prior research that intentionally incorporates negative attention scores within its framework\\n(Tay et al., 2019). However, most of these studies do not adhere to the generalized probability\\nconditions, specifically: (1) a finite range and (2) a total sum equal to 1 (or another fixed value). We\\nwill discuss the significance of adhering to these conditions and demonstrate the practical advantages\\nthrough experiment results.\\n3\\nRELATIONSHIP OF RANK-COLLAPSE AND GRADIENT VANISHING\\nIn this section, we analyze an inherent relationship between the rank-collapse and gradient vanishing\\nproblems within the conventional attention mechanism. We conjecture that the maximum total norm\\nof gradients, defined as G(Pi) = PT\\nj=1 ∥∂Pik\\n∂Aij ∥1, is attained when complete rank-collapse occurs.\\nWe substantiate this conjecture through the following lemma.\\n4\\nArxiv preprint version\\nLemma 3 (Maximum Total Norm of Gradients). The total norm of gradients, G(Pi), is maximized\\nwhen Pi is the uniform distribution, that is Pi = [ 1\\nT , 1\\nT , · · · , 1\\nT ] which is the case of complete\\nrank-collapse.\\nSee Appendix A.1.2 for the proof. To mitigate the gradient vanishing problem, it is better to input\\nsimilar token representations to make a smooth normalized attention score distribution. However,\\nthat remedy can make the rank-collapse problem severe. Therefore, mitigating both problems to-\\ngether is challenging.\\n4\\nDUAL-ATTENTION STRUCTURE OF GENERALIZED PROBABILISTIC\\nATTENTION MECHANISM\\nIn this section, we explain our proposed dual-attention implementation of GPAM within the Trans-\\nformer architecture, as illustrated in Fig.2. We further elucidate the dynamics of daGPAM with\\nrespect to the output space and representations. Additionally, we present theoretical foundations\\nsupporting the assertion that our daGPAM effectively addresses both the rank-collapse and gradient\\nvanishing problems simultaneously.\\n4.1\\nDUAL-ATTENTION GPAM (DAGPAM) STRUCTURE\\nBased on the original scaled dot-product attention mechanism (Vaswani, 2017), we add another\\nprocess of computing negative attention matrix while the original attention matrix is treated as the\\npositive attention matrix. During the computation of the negative attention matrix, we use different\\nquery vectors, but transformed from the original query vectors. Subsequently, both the positive and\\nnegative attention matrices are integrated to derive the final attention matrix, and it is multiplied to\\nthe value representations to output the final representations. This process is formulated as follows\\n(we use ‘+’ notation to the parts of the original attention part):\\nY = PGXV ,\\n(7)\\nPG = (1 + λ+)P+ −λ−P−,\\n(8)\\nP+\\nij =\\nexp(A+\\nij)\\nPT\\nk=1 exp(A+\\nik)\\n,\\nA+ =\\n\\x10p\\ndqk\\n\\x11−1\\nX+\\nQ\\n\\x00X+\\nK\\n\\x01⊤,\\n(9)\\nP−\\nij =\\nexp(A−\\nij)\\nPT\\nk=1 exp(A−\\nik)\\n,\\nA−=\\n\\x10p\\ndqk\\n\\x11−1 \\x10\\nσ(X+\\nQ)W−\\nQ\\n\\x11 \\x00X+\\nK\\n\\x01⊤,\\n(10)\\nwhere X+\\nQ = XW+\\nQ, X+\\nK = XW+\\nK, and XV = XWV . For the new, negative parts, we only add\\nthe non-linear activation, σ (we used ReLU throughout this work), and linear transformation with\\nweight matrix W−\\nQ ∈Rdqk×dqk that has small number of parameters (note that d > dqk). λ+ and\\nλ−are pre-defined or trainable scalars that control the effect of positive and negative normalized\\nattention scores, respectively.\\ndaGPAM exhibits several notable properties concerning its final normalized attention scores, de-\\nnoted as PG. Specifically, the total sum of these scores is Σ = (1 + λ+ −λ−)2 and the range of the\\nscores is constrained such that −λ−≤PG\\nij ≤(1 + λ+). In the special case where λ+ = λ−= 0,\\ndaGPAM becomes the conventional attention mechanism, Eqs.1∼3. In general, when λ+ = λ−,\\ntherefore Σ = 1, daGPAM facilitates a valid affine combination. In the next section, we will further\\nelucidate the case where λ+ ̸= λ−, that facilitates scaled-affine combination whose affine hull is\\nsimply translated.\\n4.2\\nDYNAMICS OF DUAL-ATTENTION GPAM\\nIn this section, we explain the dynamic how the output space and representations of daGPAM are\\ninfluenced by the combination of λ+ and λ−. We begin by explaining the dynamic of the output\\nspace. Based on the formulations in the previous section, the final output representations can be\\n2For simplicity, we utilize the Σ symbol to represent PT\\nj=1 PG\\nij.\\n5\\nArxiv preprint version\\nFigure 3: Different output space and representations according to λ combinations. λ−varies while\\nλ+ is fixed to 1.\\nderived and expressed as follows: Y = Σ(ˆPGXV ) = Σ ˆY where ˆPG\\nij = PG\\nij/Σ. It is important\\nto note that ˆY represents a valid affine combination of XV since the total sum of ˆPG is equal to 1.\\nConsequently, the possible outcomes for Y can be interpreted as Σ-scaled versions of the outcomes\\nfrom ˆY which reside within the affine hull defined by XV . This concept is visually represented\\nin Fig.3, where each colored plane illustrates the translated affine hull corresponding to different\\ncombinations of λs. It is noteworthy that the degree of translation is contingent upon Σ rather than\\nthe specific values of λs, so in this example, only λ−was adjusted. Constraining the output to lie\\nwithin affine hull (or translated) is critical for effective information processing. The translated affine\\nhull represents a lower-dimensional hyperplane, which is a condensed subset of the d-dimensional\\nspace determined by the processed representations from lower layers. This constraint enhances the\\ninfluence of lower layers on the information processing of upper layers, thereby improving overall\\nmodel efficacy.\\nSecondly, we examine the dynamic of output representations in relation to λs. Utilizing the def-\\ninitions established in Eqs.7 and 8, we can express Y in an alternative form as follows: Y =\\n(1+λ+)(P+XV )−λ−(P−XV ) = (1+λ+)Y+ −λ−Y−. Here, Y+ represents the output of con-\\nventional attention mechanism, and both Y+ and Y−are derived from convex combination of XV ,\\nas depicted in the third (orange) hyperplane of Fig.3. We can further reformulate this as follows:\\nY = ΣY+ + λ−(Y+ −Y−) = ΣY+ + λ−∆. A crucial characteristic of ∆is that it represents a\\ndirect movement on the hyperplane from the original point Y+, and it is manipulated by λ−, while\\nthe original point Y+ is manipulated by Σ. Consequently, when λ−is large to make Σ less than 1,\\ndaGPAM scales-down the original point while amplifying the movement on the hyperplane, result-\\ning in an increase in the relative diversity of output representations compared to their average norm.\\nThis dynamic is illustrated in Fig.3 with empirically computed cosine similarity, θ, based on our toy\\nexperiment setting3. It shows that the cosine similarity decreases with only changing λ−to make a\\nsmall Σ.\\n4.3\\nTHEORETIC ADVANTAGES OF DUAL-ATTENTION GPAM\\nIn this section, we discuss the theoretical advantages of daGPAM in addressing the issues of rank-\\ncollapse and gradient vanishing. First, to enhance our theoretical understanding of the rank-collapse\\nproblem, we derive the input/output relationship of the residual, Eq.4, based on daGPAM structure.\\nThe results of this derivation is presented in the following lemma.\\nLemma 4 (Dual-Attention GPAM residual Bound, Simplified). For any single daGPAM self-\\nattention layer with for a term γ that depends on the attention entries, the composite norm of output\\nresidual is bounded by\\n∥res(Y)∥1,∞≤Borg +\\n4\\n√\\n2γ\\n\\x10\\x0c\\x0c\\x0cλ+∥W+\\nQK∥1 −λ−∥W−\\nQK∥1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n\\x11\\n∥WV ∥1,∞\\np\\ndqk\\n∥res(X)∥3\\n1,∞, (11)\\n3We implemented daGPAM, Eqs.7∼10, with X and the weight matrices which are randomly initialized by\\nstandard Gaussian distribution. Then, we computed the average cosine similarity of each output representations\\nY with each λ combination over 100 times repeatedly.\\n6\\nArxiv preprint version\\nwhere W+\\nQK = W+\\nQ(W+\\nK)⊤and W−\\nQK = (W+\\nQW−\\nQ)(W+\\nK)⊤. Borg is the upper bound derived\\nby Lemma 1. Because the second term is positive, this upper bound is always greater than the\\noriginal.\\nThe complete lemma and its proof are provided in Appendix A.1.3. Based on this lemma, we ar-\\ngue that daGPAM can have greater or equal residual bound compared to the conventional attention\\nmechanism, which suggests a higher likelihood that the average distance between output representa-\\ntions is either maintained or not reduced compared to the average distance of input representations.\\nSecondly, we derive the gradients of daGPAM. Due to the complexity of this derivation, throughout\\nthis derivation, we consider the simple case that approximates the negative unnormalized attention\\nscore is simply the positive score with -1 multiplication, that is A+ = −A−with approximating σ\\nto identity activation and W−\\nQ ≈−I where I is identity matrix with size dqk. . The result of this\\nderivation is as follows (we simply denote A+ as A for comparison between the original lemma 2):\\nLemma 5 (Dual-Attention GPAM Gradients). The gradient that the input unnormalized attention\\nscore, A, receives through the normalized attention score, PG (without 1/\\np\\ndqk) is derived as\\nfollows:\\n∂PG\\nij\\n∂Aij\\n= gorg\\nj\\n+ λ+P+\\nij(1 −P+\\nij) + λ−P−\\nij(1 −P−\\nij),\\n(12)\\n∂PG\\nik,k̸=j\\n∂Aij\\n= gorg\\nk\\n+ λ+(−P+\\nikP+\\nij) + λ−(−P−\\nikP−\\nij),\\n(13)\\nwhere gorg\\nj\\nand gorg\\nk\\nare the derived gradient of the conventional attention mechanism, Eq.6, re-\\nspectively.\\nThe proof of this lemma is provided in Appendix A.1.4. Because the last two additional terms have\\nthe same sign of the original, daGPAM always flow greater gradients than the conventional attention\\nmechanism. Therefore, daGPAM can mitigate the rank-collapse and gradient vanishing problems\\ntogether.\\n5\\nEMPIRICAL VALIDATIONS\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of daGPAM in addressing the rank-collapse problem relative to the\\nconventional attention mechanism, we conducted rank-collapse analyses at initialization (faithful-\\nness test) (Poole et al., 2016; Schoenholz et al., 2016; Yang & Schoenholz, 2017; Hayou et al.,\\n2019; Noci et al., 2024) and after the training phase. To assess the impact on the gradient vanish-\\ning problem, we monitored the gradient norm history of the query weights, specifically ∥\\n∂L\\n∂WQ ∥2,\\nthroughout the training process. Finally, to argue the importance of preserving generalized proba-\\nbility conditions, as discussed in Section 2.3, we compare daGPAM with other several alternative\\nattention mechanisms in preliminary experiments.\\nAll empirical analyses were conducted within the framework of our preliminary experimental set-\\ntings, specifically utilizing the Penn Treebank dataset (PTB, 1M total number of tokens (Marcus\\net al., 1993)), for a world-level LM task using a 15-layered decoder-only Transformer model. We\\nemployed open-source resource4 for data-related processes, including preprocessing and tokeniza-\\ntion. Detailed configurations regarding the model architecture and optimization processes are pre-\\nsented in Table 4 in Appendix A.2. We replaced only the conventional attention layers, self-attention\\nlayer, with daGPAM. We explored various configurations, including different combinations of con-\\nstant λs and trainable λ methods.\\n5.1\\nRANK-COLLAPSE ANALYSES\\nFor the two rank-collapse analyses, we measured the amount of diversity based on the output rep-\\nresentations of self-attention layer (output of multi-head attention layer) for all layers (15, in this\\nexperiment). We used two different metrics to measure the diversity.\\n4https://github.com/kimiyoung/transformer-xl/\\n7\\nArxiv preprint version\\nFigure 4: The results of rank-collapse analyses (left two graphs) and gradient histories during train-\\ning (right two graphs).

In the analysis\\nat initialization, as known, the rank-collapse phenomenon becomes more pronounced in the upper\\nlayers. However, except for the case with (λ+ = 1.0, λ−= 0.5), daGPAM models exhibited a less\\nintensive tendency toward rank-collapse. Notably, this mitigation becomes more effective when Σ is\\nsmaller, such as in the case of (λ+ = 1.0, λ−= 2.0), where Σ = 0 showed the greatest reduction in\\nrank-collapse. In the analysis after training phase, all daGPAM models demonstrated a less intensive\\ntendency for rank-reduction compared to the baseline. These empirical findings are consistent with\\nLemma 4 and the discussions in Section 4.2. Additionally, we provide further analyses addressing\\nother aspects beyond the scope of the above experiments, including the effect of varying λ+, a rank-\\ncollapse analysis based on the output of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layer (i.e., the final output\\nof the Transformer layer), and an examination of the actual influence of the attention layer compared\\nto the shortcut branch. These additional results can be found in Appendix A.3.\\n5.2\\nGRADIENT HISTORY DURING TRAINING\\nIn addition to addressing the rank-collapse issue, we tracked the gradient norm history of the query\\nweight matrix to verify our claim regarding the gradient vanishing problem (Lemma 5). The right\\ntwo columns of Fig.4 illustrate the gradient norms of query weights across layers 5, 8, 11, and 14. In\\neach case, the query weights in daGPAM model exhibited larger gradients compared to the baseline,\\nsupporting the predictions in Lemma 5. Furthermore, the observation that higher layers receive\\nstronger gradients might align with Lemma 3. As described in the lemma, significant rank-collapse\\nleads to the maximum gradient flow through the softmax operation. Combining with the analysis\\nresult of higher layers’ more collapsed output representations (Section 5.1), we guess the lemma\\ncould explain why upper layers receive greater gradients than lower layers.\\n5.3\\nCOMPARISON BETWEEN OTHER ALTERNATIVE ATTENTION MECHANISMS\\nIn this section, we compare the performance of daGPAM with other alternative attention mecha-\\nnisms discussed in Section 2.3. We specifically focus on analyzing each mechanism’s adherence\\nto the generalized probability conditions and its corresponding performance, in order to highlight\\nthe significance of adhering these conditions. For a fair comparison, we re-implemented all alterna-\\n8\\nArxiv preprint version\\nTable 1: PTB experiment results of various attention mechanisms.

Our daGPAM models resulted in approximately 1% increases in parame-\\nters. Each model is labeled to indicate whether it adheres to the generalized probability conditions,\\nspecifically finite range and a fixed total sum of normalized attention scores. The models which\\ndo not adhere to the conditions exhibit significant performance degradation. Conversely, with the\\nexception of ‘Sin-Softmax,’ most models that adhered to both conditions performed similarly to the\\nbaseline Transformer. Although the ‘ValueSkipInit’ and ‘Shaped’ models did not degrade perfor-\\nmance, they also failed to provide improvements, because these methods regularize the attention\\nmatrix to be similar to the identity matrix, thereby weakening the contextualization effect. In con-\\ntrast, daGPAM enhances the attention mechanism itself, leading to improved performance in the\\n‘daGPAM (Trainable λs)’ model.\\n6\\nPRACTICAL BENEFITS IN BENCHMARK EXPERIMENTS\\nIn this section, we compare the performance of our models on several benchmark tasks. We con-\\nducted LM experiments on the Wikitext103 (word-level LM) and Enwiki8 (character-level LM)\\ndatasets. We followed the same data-related processes based on the same open-source of the PTB\\ndataset used in our preliminary experiment. For the baseline model, we re-implemented Trans-\\nformerXL (Dai, 2019), heavily following the public code5. This model is larger than the standard\\nTransformer and is optimized for long-context sentences. We followed the original congifurations of\\nmodel and optimization, except for modifications in the number of layers and the hyperparameters\\nrelated to daGPAM approach. For further details on the basic configurations, refer to (Dai, 2019).\\nSecond, we performed NMT experiments on the IWSLT14 English-German dataset (160K training\\npairs) and the WMT14 English-German dataset (3.9M training pairs) (Heo et al., 2024). The data\\npreprocessing steps, including tokenization and subword byte-pair encoding, were carried out using\\nthe Fairseq toolkit (Ott et al., 2019). For the baseline models, we re-implemented PreLN (Xiong\\net al., 2020) and Admin (Liu et al., 2020) encoder-decoder Transformer architectures, which are\\nwidely used NMT baselines nowadays. The basic model configurations and optimization settings are\\nprovided in Table 4 of Appendix A.2. Throughout our experiments with daGPAM models (including\\nmodels in LM task) using constant λ values, we empirically determined the optimal combination of\\nλs, which are reported in Tables 5 and 6 in Appendix A.2.\\n6.1\\nLANGUAGE MODELING\\nFor the evaluation of LM experiments, we utilized PPL for the Wikitext103 (word-level) task and\\nbits per character (BPC) for the Enwiki8 (character-level) task. The experiments were conducted by\\nvarying the number of layers in the TransformerXL model. For the TransformerXL baseline models,\\nthe number of parameters are (130.6M / 151.1M / 171.6M) and (10.3M / 41.1M) for Wikitext103\\n5https://github.com/kimiyoung/transformer-xl/\\n9\\nArxiv preprint version\\nTable 2: Experiments on wikitext103 and Enwiki8 LM tasks. ‘daGPAM (Const)’ and ‘daGPAM\\n(Train)’ mean daGPAM models with pre-defined constant λs and trainable λs, respectively.\\nModel\\nWikitext103\\nEnwiki8\\n8L\\n16L\\n24L\\n6L\\n12L\\nTransformerXL\\n25.96\\n23.58\\n22.90\\n1.1570\\n1.0544\\ndaGPAM (Const)\\n25.39\\n23.09\\n22.52\\n1.1534\\n1.0473\\ndaGPAM (Train)\\n25.33\\n23.20\\n22.57\\n1.1532\\n1.0528\\nTable 3: Experiments on IWSLT14 and WMT14 NMT tasks. ‘daGPAM (Const)’ and ‘daGPAM\\n(Train)’ were individually applied to the two architectures, respectively: PreLN (at the first row) and\\nAdmin (at the second row)\\nModel\\nIWSLT14\\nWMT14\\nEn-to-De\\nDe-to-En\\nEn-to-De\\nDe-to-En\\nPreLN\\n28.54\\n33.90\\n26.40\\n31.26\\ndaGPAM (Const)\\n29.25\\n34.43\\n26.73\\n31.43\\ndaGPAM (Train)\\n29.11\\n34.11\\n27.19\\n31.45\\nAdmin\\n28.32\\n33.48\\n26.27\\n30.61\\ndaGPAM (Const)\\n28.60\\n33.62\\n26.76\\n31.20\\ndaGPAM (Train)\\n28.43\\n33.23\\n26.79\\n31.10\\n(8L / 16L / 24L) and Enwiki8 (6L / 12L), respectively. In comparison, the number of parameters for\\ndaGPAM models are (130.7M / 151.3M / 172.0M) and (10.4M / 41.4M) for the tasks, respectively.\\nOn average, our approach increased only 0.43% of total parameters.\\nTable 2 demonstrates the results of LM experiments. It shows that daGPAM models consistently im-\\nprove performance across different layered model architectures. Specifically, our best-performing\\nmodels improve approximately 0.5 PPL on the Wikitext103 task and 0.0055 BPC on the Enwiki8\\ntask in average. Additionally, we conducted an analysis of the impact of different λ combinations\\nwithin daGPAM model, with results detailed in Appendix A.3.4. Notably, we found that configu-\\nrations where Σ is close to 0.5 yielded the optimal performance in the Wikitext103 LM task. Also,\\nthe average Σ calculated from the trained λ values in the ‘daGPAM (Train)’ (8L) is 0.3948, with\\nλ+ = 0.3303 and λ−= 0.9355.\\n6.2\\nNEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION\\nFor the evaluation of NMT experiments, we utilized case-sensitive SacreBLEU (Post, 2018). For the\\nbaseline models, the number of parameters are 64.67M and 153.84M for the IWSLT14 and WMT14\\ntasks, respectively. In comparison, the number of parameters for daGPAM models are 65.26M and\\n155.02M parameters, which is around 0.84% addition in average. Table 3 presents the results of the\\nNMT experiments. Similar to the results of the LM experiments, daGPAM models consistently out-\\nperformed the baseline models. Specifically, our best-performing models demonstrated, in average,\\n0.42 BLEU point improvement for the IWSLT14 task and 0.52 BLEU points for the WMT14 task.\\n7\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel class of attention mechanism, generalized probabilistic attention\\nmechanism (GPAM), which allows the negative attention score during the information processing.\\nAlso, we proposed one specific type of GPAM, dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM). While showing\\nthat the rank-collapse and gradient vanishing problems in the conventional attention mechanism is\\nin trade-off relationship, we showed that daGPAM could mitigate both problems. Our empirical\\nvalidations provide strong evidences supporting our theories and understanding of this approach.\\nAdditionally, our benchmark experiments demonstrate meaningful performance improvements with\\nonly a minimal increase in the number of parameters.\\n10\\nArxiv preprint version\\n8\\nFUTURE WORKS\\nAlthough we proposed only one structure of GPAM (daGPAM), GPAM does not have to be lim-\\nited to the structure. Actually, the operation of daGPAM increases computational cost due to the\\nadded scaled dot-product attention process of negative part. In future, we aim to develop a more\\nefficient structure than daGPAM while preserving the feature of GPAM. Also, beyond the standard\\nTransformer architecture discussed here, GPAM can be applied to other architectures, such as graph\\nneural networks and vision Transformer, as they are also known to experience the rank-collapse\\nproblem.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nREFERENCES\\nTom B.

For the proof of this\\nlemma, see (Dong et al., 2021).\\nLemma 6 (Dong et al. (2021)). For any single scaled dot-product self-attention layer that holds\\n|Eij −Eij′| ≤1.256 for any (i, j, j\\n′) where E = res(X) WQK\\n√\\ndqk res(X)⊤, and with γ that satisfies\\nrPT\\ni=1 max\\nj,j′ |Eij −Eij′| ≤γ\\nr\\nmax\\nj,j′\\nPT\\ni=1 |Eij −Eij′|, the composite norm of residual of its\\noutput is bounded by\\n∥res(Y)∥1,∞≤4\\n√\\n2γ∥WQK∥1∥WV ∥1,∞\\np\\ndqk\\n∥res(X)∥3\\n1,∞,\\n(14)\\nwhere WQK = WQW⊤\\nK. In the region that holds 4\\n√\\n2γ∥WQK∥1∥WV ∥1,∞<\\np\\ndqk, the output\\nresidual norm is diminished compared to the cubic rate of input residual norm.\\n13\\nArxiv preprint version\\nA.1.2\\nPROOF OF LEMMA 3\\nIn this section, we prove our proposed Lemma 3 which was introduced as follows:\\nLemma 7 (Maximum Total Norm of Gradients). The total norm of gradients, G(Pi), is maximized\\nwhen Pi is uniform distribution, that is Pi = [ 1\\nT , 1\\nT , · · · , 1\\nT ] which is the case of complete rank-\\ncollapse.\\nProof. Based on Eq.6, G(Pi) is derived as follows:\\nG(Pi) =\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\nT\\nX\\nk=1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\n∂Pik\\n∂Aij\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c =\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nT\\nX\\nk=1,k̸=j\\n| −PikPij| + Pij(1 −Pij)\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8,\\n=\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n T\\nX\\nk=1\\nPikPij + Pij(1 −2Pij)\\n!\\n,\\n=\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\nPij\\nT\\nX\\nk=1\\nPik +\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\nPij −2\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n(Pij)2,\\n= 2 −2\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n(Pij)2.\\n(15)\\nThen, our goal is to find the input probability distribution, Pi, that maximizes Eq.15, with constraint\\nPT\\nk=1 Pik = 1. We use Lagrange’s multiplier method to optimize this constrained maximization\\nproblem. With Lagrange coefficient, ζ, we derive the new objective to maximize: L(Pi, ζ) = 2 −\\n2 PT\\nj=1(Pij)2 −ζ(PT\\nk=1 Pik −1). The Jacobian of L(Pi, ζ) with respect to (Pi, ζ) is formulated\\nas follows:\\nJL =\\nh\\n∂L\\n∂Pi1\\n· · ·\\n∂L\\n∂PiT\\n∂L\\n∂ζ\\ni\\n=\\n\\x02\\n(−4Pi1 −ζ)\\n· · ·\\n(−4PiT −ζ)\\n(−PT\\nk=1 Pik + 1)\\n\\x03\\n.\\nWith setting the Jacobian to zero, the solutions are Pij = −ζ\\n4 and ζ = −4\\nT . Thus, an optimal value\\nof G(Pi) is achieved when P∗\\ni = [ 1\\nT , 1\\nT , · · · , 1\\nT ].\\nTo verify this point is the maximum, we compare G(P∗\\ni ) with the total magnitude given slightly\\nnoised probabilities, Pϵx,y\\ni\\nwhose x-th probability is 1\\nT + ϵ, and y-th probability is 1\\nT −ϵ, where\\nx, y < T and 0 < ϵ < 1\\nT . The two values are obtained as follows:\\nG(P∗\\ni ) = 2 −2\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x12 1\\nT\\n\\x132\\n= 2 −2 1\\nT ,\\nG(Pϵx,y\\ni\\n) = 2 −2\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nT\\nX\\nj=1,j̸=x,y\\n\\x12 1\\nT\\n\\x132\\n+\\n\\x12 1\\nT + ϵ\\n\\x132\\n+\\n\\x12 1\\nT −ϵ\\n\\x132\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8,\\n= 2 −2\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n\\x12 1\\nT\\n\\x132\\n+ 2ϵ2\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8,\\n= 2 −2 1\\nT −4ϵ2 < G(P∗\\ni ).\\nWe can get the same result with any different combination of x and y. Analogously, adding (and\\nsubtracting) multiple ϵi outputs lower than the optimal value. Therefore, G(P∗\\ni ) is the maximum.\\nA.1.3\\nFULL DESCRIPTION AND PROOF OF LEMMA 4\\nLemma 8 (Dual-Attention GPAM residual Bound, Completed).

Borg is the upper bound derived by Lemma 6. Since the second\\nterm is positive, this upper bound is always greater than the original.\\nProof. In this proof, we follow the derivations in (Dong et al., 2021), except the triangle inequality\\nfor the Frobenius norm formulation in the middle.\\nBy the technique described in Sec.A.4.2, the positive and negative unnormalized attention matrices,\\nEqs.9 and 10, are approximated as follows:\\nA+ ≈\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\n\\x10\\nRW+\\nQKR⊤+ 1¯x⊤W+\\nQKR⊤\\x11\\n,\\nA−≈\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\n\\x10\\nRW−\\nQKR⊤+ 1¯x⊤W−\\nQKR⊤\\x11\\n,\\nwhere W+\\nQK = W+\\nQ(W+\\nK)⊤and W−\\nQK = (W+\\nQW−\\nQ)(W+\\nK)⊤with assumption that the non-\\nlinear ReLU activation σ is identity, and R = res(X) = X −1¯x⊤. Then, the positive and negative\\nnormalized attention score matrices are formulated as follows:\\nP+ = softmax\\n\\x00E+ + 1(r+)⊤\\x01\\n,\\nP−= softmax\\n\\x00E−+ 1(r−)⊤\\x01\\n,\\nwhere E+ =\\n1\\n√\\ndqk RW+\\nQKR⊤, E−=\\n1\\n√\\ndqk RW−\\nQKR⊤, r+ =\\n1\\n√\\ndqk R(W+\\nQK)⊤¯x, and r−=\\n1\\n√\\ndqk R(W−\\nQK)⊤¯x.\\nFollowing the technique described in Sec.A.4.3, each normalized attention matrix is lower and upper\\nbounded as follows:\\n\\x00I −2D+\\x01\\n1softmax(r+)⊤≤P+ ≤\\n\\x00I + 2D+\\x01\\n1softmax(r+)⊤,\\n\\x00I −2D−\\x01\\n1softmax(r−)⊤≤P−≤\\n\\x00I + 2D−\\x01\\n1softmax(r−)⊤,\\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix whose i-th diagonal element is Dii = max\\nj,j′ |Eij −Eij′|.

We tried to use the same\\nnotations with (Vaswani, 2017), except the number of layers (# of Layers) and multi-head attention’s\\nheads (# of Heads) for clarity. ‘RAdam’ means rectified Adam (Liu et al., 2019). ‘ISRS’ indicates\\ninverse square root learning rate schedule (Ott et al., 2019) and ‘# of Tokens’ indicates the number\\nof tokens in a mini-batch at every iteration.\\nConfig.\\nPTB\\nIWSLT14\\nWMT14\\nTransformer\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\ndmodel\\n256\\n512\\n512\\n512\\n512\\ndff\\n2100\\n1024\\n1024\\n2048\\n2048\\ndqk\\n64\\n64\\n64\\n64\\n64\\nPdrop\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.1\\n0.1\\nϵls\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n# of Layers\\n15\\n6\\n6\\n6\\n6\\n# of Head\\n4\\n4\\n4\\n8\\n8\\nOptimizer\\nRAdam\\nRAdam\\nRAdam\\nRAdam\\nRAdam\\nLearning Rate\\n0.00025\\n0.0005\\n0.0005\\n0.001\\n0.001\\nScheduler\\nISRS\\nNone\\nISRS\\nNone\\nISRS\\n# of Tokens\\n4K\\n4K\\n4K\\n25K\\n25K\\nPatience\\n50\\n50\\n50\\n50\\n50\\nTable 5: Empirically found optimal λ combination for our daGPAM model with constant λs in LM\\nexperiments.\\nModel\\nWikitext103\\nEnwiki8\\n8L\\n16L\\n24L\\n6L\\n12L\\n(λ+, λ−)\\n(1.0, 1.5)\\n(1.5, 2.0)\\n(1.0, 1.0)\\n(1.0, 1.5)\\n(1.0, 1.0)\\nfor preliminary experiments (Section 5) and the benchmark NMT experiments (Section 6.2). For the\\nexperiments of benchmark LM experiments (Section 6.1), we followed the same experiment settings\\nas the original work (Dai, 2019), except the different number of layers and other things related to\\nour proposed daGPAM. For the settings of the optimal λ combinations that we used for daGPAM\\n(constant λ setting) models, we demonstrated them in Tables5 and 6.\\nDuring training of all experiments, we saved the best checkpoint based on validations. Especially,\\nfor NMT experiments, IWSLT14 and WMT14, we used checkpoint ensemble technique (Ott et al.,\\n2019) with 10 latest checkpoints at each validation. Except the benchmark LM experiments, we\\nearly stopped the training whenever the model does not over the previous best performance ‘Pa-\\ntience’ times. For the experiments of benchmark LM experiments, we ran experiments with the\\noriginal work’s default training iteration settings.\\nWe utilized single GTX1080Ti GPU for all of the preliminary experiments (Section 5). The PTB\\nLM experiments took 12 hours in average. For all of our benchmark experiments (Section 6), we\\nutilized single RTX3090 GPU. The TransformerXL-based LM experiments took averagely 20 and\\n240 hours for Wikitext-103 and Enwiki8 tasks, respectively. The NMT experiments took 75 and 120\\nhours in average for IWSLT14 and WMT14 tasks, respectively.\\nTable 6: Empirically found optimal λ combination for our daGPAM model with constant λs in NMT\\nexperiments.\\nModel\\nIWSLT14 En-to-De\\nIWSLT14 De-to-En\\nWMT14 En-to-De\\nWMT14 De-to-En\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\nPreLN\\nAdmin\\n(λ+, λ−)\\n(1.5, 1.5)\\n(2.0, 1.5)\\n(1.0, 1.5)\\n(2.0, 1.5)\\n(1.0, 1.0)\\n(1.0, 1.0)\\n(1.5, 1.5)\\n(1.0, 1.0)\\n19\\nArxiv preprint version\\nFigure 5: Results of faithfulness test (rank-collapse analysis at initialization) varying λ+ with fixing\\nλ−to 1.\\nFigure 6: Results of rank-collapse analysis after training with MLP layer’s output representations.\\nA.3\\nADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT RESULTS\\nA.3.1\\nFAITHFULNESS TEST WITH VARYING λ+\\nIn addition to the rank-collapse analysis at initialization that is conducted with varying λ−while\\nfixing λ+ to 1 (Fig.4 in Section 5.1), we conducted the same analysis with varying λ+ while fixing\\nλ−to 1. As demonstrated in Fig.5, daGPAM models achieved less intensive rank-reduciton tendency\\nthan the baseline. Similar to the phenomenon explained in Section 5.1, daGPAM model that has Σ\\nsmaller than 1 shows much less intensive tendency. For example, the (λ+ = 0.5, λ−= 1.0)\\nconfiguration shows the least intensive tendency, and this tendency is quite similar to the tendency\\nof (λ+ = 1.0, λ−= 1.5) configuration in Fig.4.\\nA.3.2\\nRANK-COLLAPSE ANALYSIS OF MLP LAYER’S OUTPUT REPRESENTATIONS\\nIn addition to the rank-collapse analysis after training based on attention layer’s output represen-\\ntations (Fig.4 in Section 5.1), we conducted the same analysis based on the MLP layer’s output\\nrepresentations which are the final outputs of each Transformer block. As demonstrated in Fig.6,\\ndaGPAM models show mitigated rank-collapse phenomenon compared to the baseline, similar to\\nthe resulting phenomenon of attention layers’ outputs.\\n20\\nArxiv preprint version\\nFigure 7:\\nCosine similarity results between the representations produced by the attention layer\\nand the subsequent residual connection, relative to the initial representations. This cosine similarity\\nserves as an indicator of the impact of the attention layer in comparison to the shortcut branch within\\nthe residual connection.\\nFigure 8: PPL results of daGPAM models (based on 8-layered TransformerXL) with various con-\\nstant λs were trained on Wikitext103 LM task. The darker the color is, the better PPL is.\\nA.3.3\\nINFLUENCE OF ATTENTION LAYERS\\nTo assure that our proposed model develops the attention layer rather than enhancing the shortcut\\nbranch like some previous works (Noci et al., 2022), we measured the cosine similarity between\\nresidual connection’s output representations and the initial representations (word embedding vec-\\ntors). This cosine similarity means the influence of attention layer within the residual connection.\\nAs demonstrated in Fig.7, we found that daGPAM models usually achieve less cosine similarity\\nwhich means the attention layers output representations are more diverse compared to the base-\\nline’s. Based on this analysis, we believe that daGPAM actually affects the attention layer rather\\nthan enhancing shortcut branch.\\nA.3.4\\nWIKITEXT103 LM EXPERIMENTS WITH VARIOUS λS\\nTo provide profound understanding on the effects of λs in practice, we conducted more Wikitext103\\nLM experiments of daGPAM models based on 8-layered TransformerXL architecture with varying\\neach λ from 0.5 to 3.0 with 0.5 interval. Note that the total sum of normalized attention score is Σ =\\n(1+λ+−λ−). We discovered that, at each value of λ+, increasing λ−improves performance until it\\nmakes Σ lower than -2.0. Usually, the best performance was achieved when Σ is 0.5. Interestingly,\\nwe found that, when Σ is 0.0, performance instantly drops. We understand the 0.0 Σ can overly\\n21\\nArxiv preprint version\\namplify the direct movement on the hyperplane, ∆, while eliminate the effect original point Y+ as\\nwe explained in Section 4.2. This may cause too diverse output representations. Empirically, we\\nfound that the cases when Σ is close to 0.5, usually be the optimal setting for daGPAM models.\\nA.4\\nTECHNICAL LEMMAS FROM (DONG ET AL., 2021)\\nA.4.1\\nPROPERTIES OF MATRIX NORM\\nIn this section, we describe the formulation and properties of matrix norm which are frequently\\nused in our proof derivations. We note that L-1 and L-∞norms of a T × d matrix, M, which are\\nformulated as follow:\\n∥M∥1 = max\\n1≤i≤d\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nT\\nX\\nj=1\\n|Mji|\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8,\\n∥M∥∞= max\\n1≤i≤T\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nd\\nX\\nj=1\\n|Mij|\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8.\\nNoticeably, ∥M∥1 = ∥M⊤∥∞.\\nIf there is a matrix N which is multiplicative with M, then\\n∥MN∥≤∥M∥∥N∥. This property holds for L-1 and L-∞norms.\\nA.4.2\\nSIMPLIFICATION OF UNNORMALIZED ATTENTION MATRIX\\nGiven the definition of the unnormalized attention matrix A, Eq.3, A is related to the residual, Eq.4,\\nas follows:\\nA =\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\n(R + 1¯x⊤)WQK(R + 1¯x⊤)⊤\\n=\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\n\\x00RWQKR⊤+ RWQK ¯x1⊤+ 1¯x⊤WQKR⊤+ 1¯x⊤WQK ¯x1⊤\\x01\\n,\\nwhere WQK = WQW⊤\\nK and R = res(X) = X −1¯x⊤. By following the shift invariance\\nproperty of the softmax function (Cordonnier et al., 2020) which means a constant term added to\\nevery element of a row is negligible, we approximate A as follows:\\neA ≈\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\n\\x00RWQKR⊤+ 1¯x⊤WQKR⊤\\x01\\n.\\nNote that every eliminated (by the approximation) terms has the form, c1⊤, so that we can ex-\\npress A = eA + c\\n′1⊤where the vector, c\\n′, is the summation of every eliminated terms without the\\ncommon factor, 1⊤. Then, the output of the softmax function with A as input is softmax(A) =\\nsoftmax( eA + c\\n′1⊤) = softmax( eA). Therefore, we can safely use the approximated unnormal-\\nized attention matrix instead of the original during the attention mechanism.\\nA.4.3\\nBOUNDS OF NORMALIZED ATTENTION MATRIX\\nWith incorporating the approximation of the unnormalized attention matrix to the definition of the\\nnormalized attention matrix, Eq.2 (without considerations of positive and negative signs), we can\\nformulate the normalized attention matrix as follows:\\nP = softmax(\\n1\\np\\ndqk\\nA) = softmax\\n\\x001r⊤+ E\\n\\x01\\n,\\nwhere E =\\n1\\n√\\ndqk RWQKR⊤and r =\\n1\\n√\\ndqk R(WQK)⊤¯x.\\nThe (i, j)-th element of P is derived as follow:\\nPij =\\nexp\\n\\x00(1r⊤)ij + Eij\\n\\x01\\nPT\\nt=1 exp ((1r⊤)it + Eit)\\n=\\nexp\\n\\x00(1r⊤)ij\\n\\x01\\nexp (Eij)\\nPT\\nt=1 exp ((1r⊤)it) exp (Eit)\\n.\\n22\\nArxiv preprint version\\nThis value is upper bounded when we replace exp(Eit) in the denominator with min\\nj′ exp(Eij′).\\nLikewise, it is lower bounded when we replace the same term with max\\nj′\\nexp(Eij′). Based on these\\nideas, we can bound the (i, j)-th element of P as follows:\\nexp(Eij)\\nmax\\nj′\\nexp(Eij′)\\nePij ≤Pij ≤\\nexp(Eij)\\nmin\\nj′ exp(Eij′)\\nePij,\\n\\x12\\nmin\\nj′ exp(Eij −Eij′)\\n\\x13\\nePij ≤Pij ≤\\n\\x12\\nmax\\nj′\\nexp(Eij −Eij′)\\n\\x13\\nePij,\\nwhere ePij =\\nexp((1r⊤)ij)\\nPT\\nt=1 exp((1r⊤)it) = softmax(1r⊤)ij = (1softmax(r)⊤)ij. Given the fact that\\nexp(x) is approximated by 1+x+ 1\\n2!x2 + 1\\n3!x3 +. . . with Taylor series near to x = 0 and it is upper\\nbounded exp(x) ≤1 + 2x where the condition |x| ≤1.256 holds, we know that max\\nj′\\nexp(Eij −\\nEij′) is upper bounded by 1 + 2 max\\nj′ (Eij −Eij′) with the condition that |Eij −Eij′| ≤1.256.\\nAnalogously, min\\nj′ exp(Eij −Eij′) is lower bounded by 1−2 min\\nj′ (Eij −Eij′). Therefore, the lower\\nand upper bounds of (i, j)-th element of P are derived as follows:\\n\\x12\\n1 −2 min\\nj′ (Eij −Eij′)\\n\\x13\\nePij ≤Pij ≤\\n\\x12\\n1 + 2 max\\nj′ (Eij −Eij′)\\n\\x13\\nePij,\\n\\x12\\n1 + 2 max\\nj′ (Eij′ −Eij)\\n\\x13\\nePij ≤Pij ≤\\n\\x12\\n1 + 2 max\\nj′ (Eij −Eij′)\\n\\x13\\nePij.\\n(21)\\nNote that the negative sign of lower bound of the first inequality goes inside of the min operation\\nwhile changing it to max operation. Finally, the matrix level inequality is formulated as follows:\\n(I −2D) eP ≤P ≤(I + 2D) eP,\\nwhere I is identity matrix.

However, it does not\\nexplicitly involve context as human cognition works, where\\ncontext plays a critical role in human visual and language\\ncomprehension. Human brain has neural networks dedicated\\nto reading and providing context from the environment in\\norder to improve perceptual learning and visual interpretation\\n[10]. In natural language understanding, context is the key\\nto derive and predict the meaning of a sentence [11]. It can\\nimprove language comprehensibility and how efﬁciently the\\ncomprehension is cognitively processed [12]. Different from\\nthis human attention mechanism, the existing attention mech-\\nanisms in deep neural networks usually concentrate on word-\\nlevel feature interactions but fail to fully account for the overall\\ncontext of the word or sentence [13]. Accordingly, the attention\\nmatrix is calculated just by two individual tokens query and\\nkey extracted from sequences without a full consideration\\nof their context, forming a standard query-key-based two-\\ndimensional attention (we call it Bi-Attention for simplicity)\\nframework to capture sequence interactions, as shown in Fig.\\n1(a). This standard Bi-Attention framework requires a deeper\\nunderstanding of the data to obtain the inner representation\\nof sequences and capture the intrinsic relationships between\\nsequences [14]. Consequently, without involving context, the\\nexisting attention models may not effectively capture really\\nimportant context-aware information [13] and may produce\\nunsatisﬁed to inaccurate attention. Some existing work has\\nidentiﬁed this design ﬂaw in the Bi-Attention mechanism and\\narXiv:2211.02899v1  [cs.CL]  5 Nov 2022\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n2\\nincorporated a contextual feature into the attention matrix. For\\nexample, the COIN and RE2 models align contextual features\\nwith attention to improve sentence representation learning,\\nyielding better results than those without context [13], [15].\\nAlthough the importance of context has been recognized in\\nthe existing work, context has only been employed as extra\\nsupporting information to sequence representation learning.\\nNo general frameworks are available to simulate human at-\\ntention with context and explicitly capture the interactions\\nbetween target and contextual sequences or information. To\\nmanage this framework gap, we propose a triple-attention\\n(Tri-Attention) framework to simulate human attention and\\nexplicitly capture interactions between sequences and between\\nsequences and context. Different from existing Bi-Attention\\nand contextual attention like COIN and RE2 models by\\nintegrating contextual features into queries and keys, our Tri-\\nAttention mechanism directly involves context as the third\\ndimension in quantifying sequence interactions. A query-key-\\ncontext three-dimensional attention framework is formed for\\nTri-Attention, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The standard Bi-Attention\\nmechanism adopts query and key to calculate two-dimensional\\nrelevance (e.g., dot product), forming an attention matrix. Then\\nmatrix operations are applied to the attention matrix and value\\nto obtain the attention embedding. Differently, the attention\\nmatrix in Tri-Attention captures three-dimensional interactions\\nbetween query, key, and context. To make value consistent\\nwith the semantic space of the triple attention matrix, the rel-\\nevance between context and value is also calculated, producing\\ncontextual value. Finally, the attention embedding is obtained\\nas a weighted linear combination of contextual value vectors.\\nWe test Tri-Attention-enabled networks for three independent\\nNLP tasks, including retrieval-based English dialogue, Chinese\\nsentence matching, and English reading comprehension. The\\nresults show that Tri-Attention outperforms most state-of-the-\\nart approaches without attention, with Bi-Attention, contextual\\nBi-Attention, and pretrained language models with context.\\nFurthermore, we evaluate the different performance of Bi-\\nAttention, contextual Bi-Attention versus Tri-Attention and the\\neffectiveness of Tri-Attention through a case study.\\nThe main contributions of this work include:\\n• The proposed Tri-Attention mechanism expands the stan-\\ndard two-dimensional attention framework to explicitly\\ninvolve and couple contextual information with query and\\nkey, hence the attention weights more sufﬁciently capture\\ncontext-aware sequence interactions. To the best of our\\nknowledge, this is the ﬁrst work on explicitly involving\\ncontext (contextual features) and learning query-key-\\ncontext interaction-based attention between sequences.\\n• Tri-attention takes a general three-dimensional tensor\\nframework, which can be instantiated into different imple-\\nmentations and applied to various tasks. We illustrate four\\nvariants by expanding the additive, dot-product, scaled\\ndot-product and trilinear operations on query, key and\\ncontext using tensor algebra for calculating Tri-Attention.\\n• Extensive experiments on three different NLP tasks\\nand their real-world public datasets demonstrate the ef-\\nfectiveness of Tri-Attention. The Tri-Attention-enabled\\nnetworks produce substantially better performance than\\nabout 30 state-of-the-art methods.\\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II\\nintroduces the related work. Section III discusses the back-\\nground and preliminaries. Section IV proposes Tri-Attention\\nmechanism and its variant implementations. Section V intro-\\nduces the multi-task-shared Tri-Attention network. Section VI\\ndemonstrates the performance of Tri-Attention by comparing\\nit with state-of-the-art methods in terms of a variety of aspects.\\nLastly, Section VII concludes this work.\\nII. RELATED WORK\\nIn this section, we brieﬂy review the related work on\\nattention mechanisms and involving contextual information in\\nattention, respectively.\\nHuman perception and visual processing may selective cer-\\ntain relevant parts of an image while ignoring other irrelevant\\ninformation [1]. This human attention mechanism has inspired\\nthe neural attention models widely applied in computer vision\\n[16]. Attention has also shown success in neural NLP tasks,\\nsuch as machine translation, automatic question answering,\\nsentence matching, and word sense disambiguation, where\\nattention usually captures the interactions between sequences.\\nFor example, in machine translation, a recurrent attention\\nmeasures the weights of all heads in each Transformer layer\\nto build more efﬁcient neural machine translation models\\n[17]. In [18], syntax-enhanced attention mechanisms SEAs\\nimprove syntactic-enhanced machine translation by involving\\na dependency mask bias and a relative local-phrasal position\\nbias. In [19], a source-target bilingual syntactic alignment\\nSyntAligner aligns the syntactic structures of source and\\ntarget sentences with border-sensitive span attention and then\\nmaximizes their mutual dependency for machine translation. In\\nautomatic question answering, a Block-Skim attention mech-\\nanism measures the importance of tokens and blocks to skim\\nunnecessary context, improving the Transformer performance\\n[20]. In sentence semantic matching (SSM), A 3D CNN-based\\nSSM model ﬁrst constructs multi-dimensional representations\\nfor each sentence, then utilizes a 3D CNN and an attention\\nmechanism to learn the interactive matching features [21].\\nIn word sense disambiguation (WSD), an extractive sense\\ncomprehension mechanism employs local self-attention to\\nconstraint attentions to be local, which allows to handle longer\\ncontext without heavy computing burdens [22].\\nIn NLP tasks, the existing Bi-Attention mechanisms calcu-\\nlate attention scores by focusing on local relevance matching\\nat the token level without explicitly taking their overall context\\ninto account. Each element of the attention matrix is only\\ncomputed based on two individual tokens query and key.\\nThis two-dimensional Bi-Attention mechanism ignores the\\ninteractions with and inﬂuence of their context, e.g., contextual\\nwords or sentences surrounding target words. On one hand,\\ncontextual information may involve important information and\\ninﬂuence on the target, as demonstrated in other areas such\\nas contextual and sequential recommender systems [23] and\\ncontextual matrix factorization [24]. On the other, the inter-\\nactions and couplings between a target and its context form\\nessential constituents of the target, as shown in attribute/feature\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n3\\ninteraction analysis [25], [26], and multi-party interaction\\nlearning [27], [28]. These prompt the potential and need for\\nincluding context and target-context interactions into neural\\nattention mechanisms.\\nIn fact, various efforts aim to involve contextual information\\nin Bi-Attention mechanisms for NLP [13], [29], [30]. For\\nexample, Yang et al. [29] directly incorporate contextual\\ninformation into the representations of query and key with\\naddition operations. Ding et al. [30] argue that the existing\\ncross-attention was confused by the localness perception prob-\\nlem, which fails to adequately capture the whole context. A\\ncontext-aware cross-attention method models both local and\\nglobal contexts, which uses an interpolation gating mechanism\\nto combine the original and local cross-attention. Hu et al.\\n[13] propose a context-aware attention network (COIN) for\\nsentence matching. Its core component is a context-aware\\ninteraction block consisting of a context-aware cross-attention\\nlayer and a gate fusion layer, which consults contextual\\ninformation to enable better alignments and blends the original\\nand aligned representations with a gate connection.\\nIn addition, contextual information or contextual attention\\nhas also been applied in various non-NLP tasks, such as image\\ninpainting [31], [32], video captioning [33], recommendation\\n[23], [34], and decision making [35], [36]. Regarding contex-\\ntual attention for various vision and image-related tasks, for\\ninstance, in [31], contextual attention in CNN synthesizes both\\nimage structures and surrounding image features as references\\nfor image inpainting. The selective contextual attention in\\n[37] further learns pixel- and patch-level attentions from back-\\nground regions and selectively utilizes contextual attention to\\nenhance the original features. The contextual attention network\\nin [33] ﬁrst extracts visual and textual features at each time\\nstep, then utilizes a contextual attention mechanism to capture\\nmore information for captioning. In contextual attention-based\\nrecommendation, for example, attention-based inﬂuential con-\\ntexts are modeled by involving heterogeneous relations for\\nrecommendation [34]. In [23], the attention of context is\\nmeasured and incorporated into sequential recommendation.\\nThese studies show the great potential of integrating context\\nwith attention for non-NLP tasks. Furthermore, in contextual\\nreinforcement learning (cRL), a contextual MDP (cMDP) ex-\\ntended the standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) to learn\\ncontext-conditioned policies, which increases the robustness\\nand generalization of RL models [35], [36].\\nAlthough the above-mentioned work strives to implement\\ncontextual attention to model the inﬂuence from context, they\\ndo not directly capture target-context interactions, i.e., the\\ninteractions between context, query and key in calculating\\nattention scores. They still rely on the framework of standard\\nquery-key-based Bi-Attention mechanism, merely integrate\\ncontextual information and the original representation using\\naddition operations or gating mechanisms, there are no-to-\\nweak interactions between contextual information and the\\nrepresentations of query and key.\\nTo address the shortage of two-dimensional query-key at-\\ntention and the limitation of existing studies, we propose a\\nquery-key-context triple attention (Tri-Attention) framework.\\nTri-Attention uses tensor algebra techniques to explicitly in-\\nvolve contextual information and capture query-key-context\\ninteractions. In calculating the attention matrix, Tri-Attention\\nincorporates contextual information and treats it equally with\\nthe Bi-Attention factors query, key, and value. In this way,\\nTri-Attention expands Bi-Attention mechanisms by allowing\\ncontextual information to explicitly participate in calculating\\nattention weights.\\nConsequently, the contextual information in Tri-Attention\\nplays an essential role in capturing the interactions between\\nsequences under their contexts. This also expands the con-\\ntextual Bi-Attention mechanisms where context only plays a\\ncomplementary role.\\nIII. BACKGROUND AND PRELIMINARIES\\nHere, we introduce tensor algebra and the design of the\\nstandard Bi-Attention mechanism. These lay the foundation\\nof our proposed Tri-Attention.\\nA. Tensor Algebra\\nOur Tri-Attention builds on tensor algebra to incorporate\\nand interact context with query, key, and value and calculate\\nattention weights on the query-key-context tensor. Therefore,\\nhere, we introduce the essential algebraic notations and con-\\ncepts. We use a bold uppercase symbol to represent a matrix,\\ne.g., X; a bold lowercase for a vector (column), e.g., x;\\nand a lowercase or uppercase for a scalar, e.g., x or X. A\\ntensor is denoted by a bold calligraphic symbol, e.g., a three-\\ndimensional real-valued tensor: X ∈RI×J×K.\\nThe tensor or vector matrix multiplication [38] is applied\\nto calculate Tri-Attention weights. Given a tensor X\\n∈\\nRI1×I2×···×IN , and a matrix Y\\n∈\\nRJ×In, the n-mode\\nproduct of X and Y\\nis deﬁned as X ×n Y\\n= Z\\n∈\\nRI1×I2×···×In−1×J×In+1×···×IN , where\\nZi1i2···in−1jin+1···iN =\\nIn\\nX\\nin=1\\nxi1i2···in−1inin+1···iN yjin.\\n(1)\\nSimilarly, the n-mode product between X\\nand column\\nvector y\\n∈\\nRIn\\nis written as X ×n y⊺\\n=\\nZ\\n∈\\nRI1×I2×···×In−1×1×In+1×···×IN with element-wise entry as:\\nZi1i2···in−11in+1···iN =\\nIn\\nX\\nin=1\\nxi1i2···in···iN yin.\\n(2)\\nOftentimes, the trivial n-th dimension in Z is squeezed out\\nsuch that Z ∈RI1×I2×···×In−1×In+1×···×IN is (n −1)-way.\\nIn this work, we keep this dimension for the convenience in\\nformulating the Trilinear attention in Section IV.\\nTo formulate our idea, we use C=[c1, c2, · · · , cJ] ∈RD×J\\nto represent the contextual matrix which contains J context\\nvectors. Each contextual vector is a column vector of length D,\\nthat is cj ∈RD, j = 1, 2, · · · , J. In this paper, a vector refers\\nto a column vector by default. The key information is repre-\\nsented by matrix K=[k1, k2, · · · , kI] ∈RD×I which includes\\nI key vectors of D dimensions. Similarly, the corresponding\\nvalue information is represented by V =[v1, v2, · · · , vI] ∈\\nRD×I. In general, a query vector is denoted by q ∈RD.\\nFor N query vectors, we use Q ∈RD×N.\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n4\\nB. Standard Bi-Attention Mechanism\\nThe standard Bi-Attention mechanism customarily obtains\\ninteractive features by calculating the relevance score between\\nsequences. It consists of three major steps.\\nFirst, the relevance F(q, ki) between query q and key ki\\nis calculated:\\nF(q, ki) = Similarity(q, ki),\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(3)\\nSecond, F(q, ki) is normalized by the softmax function:\\nαi =\\nexp\\n\\x00F(q, ki)\\n\\x01\\nIP\\ni′=1\\nexp\\n\\x00F(q, ki′)\\n\\x01,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(4)\\nwhere αi is the normalized attention weight.\\nLastly, the attention embedding is obtained by a weighted\\nlinear combination with value vi:\\nqnew =\\nI\\nX\\ni=1\\nαivi = V α.\\n(5)\\nIn practice, the similarity measure is not unique, resulting\\nin different attention mechanisms and designs. The four most\\ncommonly used similarity measure methods are additive (Add)\\nsimilarity, dot-product (DP) similarity, scaled dot-product\\n(SDP) similarity, and bilinear (Bili) similarity.\\nAdditive (Add) similarity [39]:\\nF(q, ki) = p⊺tanh(W q + Uki),\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(6)\\nDot-product (DP) similarity [40]:\\nF(q, ki) = q⊺ki,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(7)\\nScaled dot-product (SDP) similarity [41]:\\nF(q, ki) = q⊺ki\\n√\\nD\\n,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(8)\\nBilinear (Bili) similarity [40]:\\nF(q, ki) = q⊺W ki,\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I,\\n(9)\\nW , U and p are learnable parameters.\\nThe main drawback of the standard Bi-Attention mecha-\\nnisms lies in that the relevance scores between sequences only\\nbuild on the token representations of q and ki. No contextual\\ninformation and the interaction between context and query and\\nkey are involved, which may miss important environmental\\ninformation and cause inaccurate relevance.\\nIV. TRI-ATTENTION MECHANISM\\nIn this section, we introduce the proposed Tri-Attention\\nmechanism. It extends the Bi-Attention mechanisms and builds\\non tensor operations for variant implementations of the query-\\nkey-context similarity.\\nContext\\nKey\\nQuery\\nValue\\nValue\\nCon_Value\\nF(Query,Key)\\nSoftMax\\nMatMul\\na.

The elements in red refer to the new\\nmodules introduced by Tri-Attention, which adjust standard\\nquery-key-value to be context dependent. As a result, the\\ncalculation of contextual relevance scores is semantically\\nconsistent with the computation of contextual values.\\nA. Framework of Tri-Attention Mechanism\\nThe Tri-Attention mechanism expands the standard query-\\nkey similarity-based Bi-Attention mechanism in Section III-B\\nto query-key-context tensor similarity, which thus explicitly\\ninvolves contextual information and captures the interactions\\nbetween target sequences and their contexts. Tri-Attention\\nengages contextual features in calculating the relevance scores\\nbetween sequences and then adjusts values to be context\\ndependent. Bi-Attention can be viewed as a special case\\nof Tri-Attention without the explicit dimension of context.\\nOnce context is removed, Tri-Attention is degraded to Bi-\\nAttention. Fig. 2 illustrates the main ideas and processes of\\nBi-Attention versus Tri-Attention mechanism. The extension\\nof Bi-Attention to Tri-Attention is marked in red for differen-\\ntiating the two mechanisms.\\nIn contrast to the standard three-step attention learning in\\nBi-Attention, Tri-Attention generalizes their ﬁrst and third\\nsteps. In the ﬁrst step, Tri-Attention ﬁrst expands the similar-\\nity calculation by involving contextual information to obtain\\ncontext-dependent query-key relevance scores, forming con-\\ntextual relevance score. In the third step, Tri-Attention explic-\\nitly integrates context and value to produce context-dependent\\nvalue, resulting in contextual value. The resultant contextual\\nvalue resides in the same semantic space as contextual rele-\\nvance scores. Both capture extra contextual information and\\nquery-key-value-context interactions for a more informative\\nbut semantically consistent attention representation.\\nB. Contextual Relevance Score\\nTo obtain relevance scores informative to the context of\\ntarget sequences, we expand the relevance calculation meth-\\nods including additive, dot-product, scaled dot-product, and\\nbilinear similarity in Section III-B by explicitly incorporating\\ncontextual information as a third dimension. This results in\\nfour contextual relevance similarity calculators: T-additive\\n(TAdd), T-dot-product (TDP), T-scaled-dot-product (TSDP),\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n5\\nand Trilinear (Trili) operations on the query-key-context tensor\\nby applying the tensor-matrix or vector product operations\\ndeﬁned in Eqs. (1) and (2). Here, preﬁx “T-” indicates its roles\\nfor Tri-Attention by involving the third dimension context into\\nattention mechanisms.\\nT-additive (TAdd) similarity: The T-additive similarity ex-\\npands the additive similarity in Eq. (6) by adding a context\\ndimension cj to the usual terms q and ki, formulated below:\\nF(q, ki, cj) = p⊺tanh(W q + Uki + Hcj),\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n(10)\\nwhere W , U, H, and p are learnable parameters.\\nT-dot-product (TDP) similarity: The T-dot-product similar-\\nity expands the standard query-key dot-product attention in\\nEq. (7) for Bi-Attention to the query-value-context T-dot-\\nproduct attention. T-dot-product attention replaces the inner\\nproduct of query and value vectors by the contextual inner\\nproduct between the query, value, and context vectors, which\\nis formulated below:\\nF(q, ki, cj) =\\nD\\nX\\nd=1\\nqdkidcjd = ⟨q, ki, cj⟩\\n= I ×1 q⊺×2 k⊺\\ni ×3 c⊺\\nj\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n,\\n(11)\\nwhere ⟨q, ki, cj⟩is the contextual inner product of three\\nvectors; q⊺, k⊺\\ni , and c⊺\\nj , which are treated as row vectors,\\ni.e. of size 1 × D. ×1, ×2, and ×3 are 1-mode, 2-mode,\\nand 3-mode tensor-matrix or vector multiplication operators,\\nrespectively. I is a 3-way identity tensor of size D × D × D,\\nwhere only the (d, d, d)-th element is 1 (d = 1, 2, · · · , D), and\\nothers are 0. The resultant F(q, ki, cj) is a scalar (i.e., of size\\n1 × 1 × 1).\\nT-scaled-dot-product\\n(TSDP)\\nsimilarity:\\nSimilarly,\\nthe\\nscaled-dot-product attention in Eq. (8) for Bi-Attention is gen-\\neralized to T-scaled-dot-product. T-scaled-dot-product divides\\nthe contextual inner product by the squared root of the number\\nof dimensions:\\nF(q, ki, cj) =\\nPD\\nd=1 qdkidcjd\\n√\\nD\\n= ⟨q, ki, cj⟩\\n√\\nD\\n=\\nI ×1 q⊺×2 k⊺\\ni ×3 c⊺\\nj\\n√\\nD\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n.\\n(12)\\nTrilinear (Trili) similarity: With context involved, the bi-\\nlinear form in Eq. (9) is naturally extended to a multilinear,\\nprecisely trilinear, form using tensor-vector products, labeled\\nas Trilinear:\\nF(q, ki, cj) =\\nD\\nX\\nd=1\\nD\\nX\\nd′=1\\nD\\nX\\nd′′=1\\nwdd′d′′qdkid′cjd′′\\n= W ×1 q⊺×2 k⊺\\ni ×3 c⊺\\nj\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n,\\n(13)\\nThe learnable weight tensor W ∈RD×D×D governs the\\ninteractions between any dimensions of the three vectors. T-\\ndot-product and T-scaled-dot-product are special cases of this\\ngeneral form. A nice property of this contextual generalization\\nis that the contextual relevance scores can be computed and\\nstored in a tensor using query, key, and context matrices:\\nF(Q, K, C) = W ×1 Q⊺×2 K⊺×3 C⊺∈RN×I×J where\\nN, I, and J are the number of query vectors, key vectors, and\\ncontext vectors, respectively. However, the size of W grows\\nin a cubic way. Hence, F(Q, K, C) may not scale well. In\\npractice, we can use an economic version as follows:\\nF(q, ki, cj) = ⟨W q, Uki, Hcj⟩\\n= I ×1 (W q)⊺×2 (Uki)⊺×3 (Hcj)⊺\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n,\\n(14)\\nwhere W , U, and H are learnable matrices. Concisely, for\\nmatrix inputs, we have F(Q, K, C) = I ×1 (W Q)⊺×2\\n(UK)⊺×3 (HC)⊺∈RN×I×J.\\nC. Normalized Contextual Relevance Score\\nConsistent with the Bi-Attention mechanism, the contextual\\nrelevance score F(q, ki, cj) calculated by Eq. (14) for Tri-\\nAttention is also normalized by the softmax function:\\nαc\\nij =\\nexp\\n\\x00F(q, ki, cj)\\n\\x01\\nIP\\ni′=1\\nJP\\nj′=1\\nexp\\n\\x00F(q, ki′, cj′)\\n\\x01\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n.\\n(15)\\nConsequently, the attention weights for query q is represented\\nby matrix Ac ∈RI×J.\\nD. Contextual Value\\nThe above contextual relevance scores contain contextual\\ninformation and interactions between context, query, and key.\\nTo semantically match value to this contextual relevance score,\\nwe further integrate value with context using one of the\\nfollowing methods to obtain contextual value.\\nAdditive context-value integration:\\nvc\\n(i,j) = vi + cj\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J.\\n(16)\\nMultiplicative context-value integration:\\nvc\\n(i,j) = vi ∗cj\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J\\n(17)\\nwhere ∗is the Hadamard product operator.\\nBilinear context-value integration:\\nvc\\n(i,j) = (U ′vi) ∗(H′cj)\\ni = 1, 2, · · · , I; j = 1, 2, · · · , J.\\n(18)\\nIn Eqs. (16)-(18), vc\\n(i,j) ∈RD. These methods generate the\\ncontextual value tensor Vc ∈RI×J×D.\\nE. Contextual Attention Embedding\\nSince there are different approaches to obtain contextual\\nattention weight matrix Ac by Eq. (15) and value tensor\\nVc per Eqs. (16)-(18), for the semantic consistency, their\\noperation may be consistent. For example, if T-additive in\\nEq. (10) is applied to obtain αc\\nij, then additive context-value\\nintegration in Eq.

Choice of Contexts\\nSince contextual information varies over tasks and deﬁni-\\ntions, the acquisition of context is task-speciﬁc [13], [15], [30],\\n[36], [42]. As an example by following the practice in [42] for\\nNLP tasks, we ﬁrst choose the encoding results of BERT for\\ndifferent sequences as the preliminary contextual information.\\nThen an average pooling operation is applied to obtain the\\nﬁnal contextual features.\\nMore speciﬁcally, assume a task consists of several input\\nsequences S1, S2, · · · , and SK. First, we segment each se-\\nquence according to the minimum granularity of the language\\nunderlying the inputs. For example, if the sequences are in\\nChinese, Chinese can be segmented in terms of Chinese char-\\nacters. In contrast, if English is involved, the inputs should be\\nsegmented on the granularity of words. Then, we concatenate\\nthe segmented sequences with segments {SEP} to a new\\nsequence as follows:\\nS = {[CLS], S1, [SEP], · · · , [SEP], SK, [SEP]}\\n= {[CLS], w1\\n1, · · · , w\\nlS1\\n1 , [SEP], · · · , [SEP],\\nw1\\nK, · · · , w\\nlSK\\nK , [SEP]},\\n(20)\\nwhere wl\\nk is the l-th token in the k-th sequence. Finally, we\\nfeed this new sequence S into BERT to obtain the contextual\\ninformation, which consists of a list of vectors corresponding\\nto all tokens respectively. It is worth noting that the output of\\nBERT consists of two parts, and we use the ﬁrst part as the\\ncontextual feature.\\nV. A MULTI-TASK-SHARED TRI-ATTENTION NETWORK\\nHere, we apply Tri-Attention in diverse NLP tasks by con-\\nstructing a multi-task-shared Tri-Attention-enabled network\\n(TAN). We test Tri-Attention for retrieval-based dialogue,\\nsentence semantic matching, and machine reading comprehen-\\nsion. Accordingly, the shared architecture of our Tri-Attention\\nnetwork for these tasks is shown in Fig. 3.\\nTAN consists of two main panels. The left consists of three\\ninput modules corresponding to three NLP tasks, respectively.\\nFor each task, its input sequences and contexts speciﬁed ac-\\ncording to the task-speciﬁc requirement, which are marked by\\ndifferent colors. The right panel implements the corresponding\\nattention mechanism and learning tasks. It consists of ﬁve\\ncore modules: encoding module, ﬁltering module, interaction\\nmodule, aggregation module, and prediction module. First, the\\nencoding module employs BERTt to encode the two input\\nsequences to obtain their feature representations, and utilizes\\nBERTn to encode the context to obtain the contextual feature\\nrepresentation. Second, the ﬁltering module trims the sequence\\nlength of the above representations to facilitate the following\\nprocessing. Third, the interaction module applies Tri-Attention\\nto engage three representations of input and context sequences\\nand then couple them by the Tri-Attention mechanism. The\\nstack number (i.e., N in Fig. 3) of interaction modules is\\nadjustable per learning task requirements and based on the\\nrelevance score calculation methods, as shown in Table IV.\\nFurthermore, the feature aggregation module performs the\\naverage-pooling of the representations of two input sequences\\nto ﬁlter them and then concatenates their representations with\\nthe pooling representation of the output of BERTn, and the\\ndifference between representations of two input sequences.\\nLastly, a prediction module feeds the above four represen-\\ntations to a softmax function to predict the ﬁnal response\\nmatching score. Below, in discussing the experimental settings\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n7\\nfor each task, we will further explain the task-speciﬁc settings\\nto customize TAN for each task.\\nVI. EXPERIMENTS\\nTo verify the effectiveness of Tri-Attention mechanism in\\ncomparison with Bi-Attention, we conduct extensive exper-\\niments on three NLP tasks: retrieval-based dialogue, sen-\\ntence semantic matching, and machine reading comprehen-\\nsion. Three public datasets are used to evaluate the results by\\ncomparing with different baseline methods for each task. In\\naddition, we report the results of ablation study and case study.\\nA. Evaluation Tasks and Their Datasets\\nWe evaluate Tri-Attention in three diverse NLP tasks:\\nretrieval-based dialogue, sentence semantic matching, and\\nmachine reading comprehension. These tasks and their cor-\\nresponding datasets are introduced below.\\n• Retrieval-based dialogue. Given historical dialogue utter-\\nances, this task selects the correct response from multiple\\ncandidate responses. A commonly used data Ubuntu\\nCorpus V1 [43] is tested here. It is a public dialogue\\ndataset containing some 1 million multi-turn dialogues,\\nwith a total of over 7 million utterances and 100 million\\nwords. The ratio of positive versus negative instances\\nin the training set is 1:1. The ratio of positive versus\\nnegative instances in the validation and test sets is 1:9.\\nTable I illustrates the samples from the Ubuntu Corpus\\nV1 corpus. S1-S6 are historical dialogue utterances, and\\nthe candidate response utterances consist of a positive\\ncase and a negative case.\\nS1\\nhey guys i am trying to compile an\\napplication\\npath\\nwent well and\\nit created a\\npath\\nwhich takes\\nsome arguments but i dont know\\nhow to use this ﬁle ... can somebody\\ngive me a hint\\nHistorical\\nS2\\ndid n’t\\npath\\ncreated a makeﬁle\\ndialogue\\nS3\\nikonia take a look at this\\nurl\\nutterances\\nS4\\nit did but is does nothing\\nS5\\nit just mentions make *** no targets\\nspeciﬁed and no makeﬁle found stop .”\\nS6\\nseems like\\npath\\nuses this .. you\\ndo n’t have to run this manually\\nPositive\\nlook at the install ﬁle i think i just\\nCandidate\\n(label:1)\\nhave to pass the right arguments\\nresponse\\nthanks a lot i think i have more to go\\nutterances\\nNegative\\non for my little project the syntax there\\n(label:0)\\nthere is pretty easy to parse and all you\\nneed is to make wget download that url\\nTABLE I: Instances of retrieval-based dialogues [43].\\n• Sentence semantic matching. This task decides whether\\ntwo sentences share similar meaning. We use a large-\\nscale Chinese corpus LCQMC [44] for sentence semantic\\nmatching. It consists of 260,068 question pairs collected\\nby Baidu Knows. There are three subsets: 238,766 ques-\\ntion pairs for training, 8,802 question pairs for validation,\\nand 12,500 question pairs for test. Table II illustrates two\\nof its instances in LCQMC.\\nS1\\n哪首歌里有这句歌词\\nPositive\\n(En: Which song has this lyrics)\\n(label:1)\\nS2\\n这句歌词是哪首歌的？\\n(En: Which song does this lyric come from?)\\nS3\\n哪些浏览器可以看电影\\nNegative\\n(En: Which browser can play movies)\\n(label:0)\\nS4\\n什么浏览器可以下电影\\n(En: Which browser can download movies)\\nTABLE II: Instances of sentence semantic matching data [44].\\n• Machine reading comprehension. Given a passage and\\nits corresponding question, this task identiﬁes the correct\\nanswer from multiple candidate choices. RACE [45]\\nis recognized as one of the largest and most difﬁcult\\nEnglish datasets for multi-choice reading comprehension.\\nIt consists of two subsets: RACE-M and RACE-H, cor-\\nresponding to the difﬁculty level for middle school and\\nhigh school, respectively.

TAN Settings\\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the contextual information in Tri-\\nAttention the concatenation of the outputs of BERT applied on\\ninput sequences, consistent with [42]. It is shown in [46] that\\nthe outputs of different layers of BERT can capture different\\nsentence features. Inspired by this, our experiment shows that\\nbetter performance can be achieved using the output of layer 1\\nas the representation of a single sequence. When the ﬁnal rep-\\nresentations of different sequences are obtained, we ﬁlter the\\nrepresentations by average pooling. Finally, inspired by [47],\\nwe concatenate the representations of different sequences, the\\ndifferential representations between sequences, and the pooled\\nrepresentation of BERT. The concatenate results are fed to\\nsoftmax for classiﬁcation. We also add the dropout strategy\\nwith dropout rate 0.1 following [48]. The above settings are\\napplied to all three tasks: retrieval-based dialogue, sentence\\nsemantic matching, and machine reading comprehension.\\nIn addition, some hyperparameters are set for different tasks.\\nThe learning rate 1e-5 is used for retrieval-based dialogue, and\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n8\\nTask\\nDataset\\nTri-AttentionTAdd\\nTri-AttentionTDP\\nTri-AttentionTSDP\\nTri-AttentionTrili\\nRetrieval-based dialogue\\nUbuntu Corpus V1\\n3\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nSentence semantic matching\\nLCQMC\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n1\\nMachine reading comprehension\\nRACE\\n4\\n3\\n4\\n1\\nTABLE IV: Number of Tri-Attention layers with different similarity operations in TAN for different NLP tasks and datasets.\\n2e-5 for both sentence semantic matching and machine reading\\ncomprehension.

AdamW [49]\\nis used for the optimization of retrieval-based dialogue and\\nsentence semantic matching, and BertAdam [50] for machine\\nreading comprehension. In TAN, Tri-Attention is stackable,\\nthus the number of its layers is adjusted for different tasks.\\nTable IV describes the number of layers for different tasks and\\ndatasets under different Tri-Attention similarity operations.\\nC. Task 1: Retrieval-based Dialogue\\nHere, we evaluate TAN with Tri-Attention mechanism\\nagainst three categories of baselines for retrieval-based dia-\\nlogue. The baselines consist of non-attention classic models,\\nstandard Bi-Attention-based neural networks with context or\\ninteraction, and pretrained neural language networks.\\n1) Baseline Methods: First, several non-attention classic\\nmethods are compared with TAN:\\n• TF-IDF: A statistical method obtains the relevance fea-\\ntures of sentences per the frequency of characters [43].\\n• RNN: A simple RNN encodes utterances to obtain a\\nfeature representation and calculates the relevance score\\nbased on the representation [43].\\n• CNN: A CNN extracts utterance features and calculates\\nthe relevance representation of the features [51].\\n• LSTM: LSTM serves as the context encoder to extract\\nutterance features and then calculates the relevance rep-\\nresentation [51].\\nSecond, several advanced neural networks with standard Bi-\\nAttention mechanisms with context or interaction are com-\\npared with TAN:\\n• SMN: A sequential matching network selects responses\\nto multi-turn conversations, which matches a response to\\neach utterance in the context at multi-level granularities\\nand utilizes RNN to accumulate the matching vectors to\\nmodel the relations between utterances [52].\\n• DUA: A self-matching attention routes the vital informa-\\ntion in each utterance then matches a response to each\\nreﬁned utterance, followed by attention mechanism to\\naggregate matching vectors to obtain the ﬁnal matching\\nscore [53].\\n• DAM: It constructs the representations of utterances at\\ndifferent granularities solely with stacked self-attention\\nthen calculates the matching score between the context\\nand response by cross-attention [54].\\n• IoI: An interaction-over-interaction network performs\\nmatching by stacking multiple interaction blocks to\\nachieve deep interaction between responses and utter-\\nances [55].\\n• ESIM: A sequential matching model based only on\\nchain sequence to select multi-turn responses, which\\ninvolves an enhanced sequential inference model and\\nsoft-alignment attention [56].\\n• MSN: A multi-hop selector network selects the relevant\\nutterances as the context then calculates the matching\\nscore between the context and response [57].\\nLastly, we compare TAN with several pretrained neural\\nlanguage models:\\n• BERT: A classical pretrained language model, which is\\nﬁne-tuned for retrieval-based dialogue [50].\\n• RoBERTa-SS-DA: A RoBERTa-based approach, where a\\nspeaker segmentation scheme and dialogue augmentation\\nimprove the performance [58].\\n• BERT-DPT: It enhances the BERT ability by post-training\\non domain-speciﬁc corpus to train contextualized repre-\\nsentations that are missing in general corpus [59].\\n• BERT-VFT: A ﬁne-tuned model based on BERT, which\\ninvolves parameter-efﬁcient transfer learning for various\\ntasks [60].\\n• SA-BERT: A speaker-aware BERT-based model, which\\nperceives the change of speaker information and incor-\\nporates domain knowledge into pretrained BERT [61].\\n• UMSBERT+: Utterance manipulation strategies are used to\\nselect multi-turn responses, including utterance insertion,\\ndeletion, and search strategies, to address some deﬁcien-\\ncies in existing BERT models [62].\\n• BERT-SL: A context-response matching model based on\\npretrained language models, which introduces four self-\\nsupervised tasks to jointly train the response selection\\nmodel in a multi-task manner [63].\\n• BERT-UMS+FGC: A ﬁne-grained contrastive learning\\nmethod for response selection, which generates better\\nmatching representation at ﬁner granularity to select\\npositive responses [64].\\n2) TAN Settings: The TAN with Tri-Attention in Fig. 3 is\\nspeciﬁed as follows for retrieval-based dialogue. The inputs\\nshown on the left panel consist of question, response, and\\ncontext. A question is the last sentence in the dialogue history\\nand a response is the original response in the dataset. The\\ncontext is the concatenation of dialogue and response [42]. The\\nmodel on the right panel has ﬁve core modules, as described\\nin Section V. The performance is evaluated by Rn@k, which\\ndenotes whether the top-k retrieved responses from the n\\ncandidate responses contain the right responses.\\n3) Performance Evaluation:\\nThe performance of TAN\\nagainst all baseline models is shown in Table V. We obtain\\nthe following observations.\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n9\\nFirst, compared with the non-attention classic methods, the\\nadvantage of TAN is very signiﬁcant. The classic methods\\nmodel sentences only using observable word features and\\nsimple interaction patterns to evaluate each candidate response.\\nThey are unable to effectively utilize latent semantic infor-\\nmation and learn complex interaction patterns. Thanks to the\\npowerful pretrained language model and the Tri-Attention\\nmechanism, TAN learns more sophisticated semantic features\\nthan these baselines. The learned contextual features are bene-\\nﬁcial for representing utterances and responses, thus measuring\\ntheir relevance more accurately.\\nSecond, compared with Bi-Attention and interaction-based\\nnetworks, TAN also performs much better. This is probably\\nbecause TAN employs the pretrained BERTbase model trained\\non large corpus, which enhances our model with great prior\\nknowledge. In contrast, the benchmarks do not involve the vast\\namount of prior knowledge.\\nThird, TAN also outperforms the pretrained BERT, which is\\nthe state-of-the-art language model with self-attention mecha-\\nnism. Although BERT gains rich prior knowledge pretrained\\non a vast amount of textual data, it may not capture interactions\\nand contexts between utterances and responses for this task.\\nIn addition, BERT pretrained on a general corpus may not be\\nadaptive to this domain-speciﬁc dialogue dataset. In contrast,\\nTAN applies Tri-Attention to explicitly capture contexts and\\nadopts the post-training strategy in [59] on the task dataset to\\noptimize its speciﬁcity and adaptability.\\nLastly, TAN with Tri-Attention consistently outperforms\\nall pretrained BERT variants. Although most baselines also\\nperform post-training, they may fail to incorporate contextual\\ninformation and accurately capture interactive features be-\\ntween utterances and responses. In contrast, Tri-Attention fully\\nconsiders the context in its attention mechanism to determine\\nthe relevance between utterances and responses, contributing\\nto the improved performance of TAN over the BERT variants.\\nD. Task 2: Sentence Semantic Matching\\nWe further test TAN with Tri-Attention mechanism against\\nthree categories of baselines for sentence semantic matching.\\nThe baselines consist of non-attention classic networks, more\\nadvanced networks with relations or standard Bi-Attention-\\nbased context, and pretrained neural language networks.\\n1) Baseline Methods: First, several non-attention classic\\nnetworks are compared to TAN with Tri-Attention:\\n• WMDchar and\\nWMDword: They apply the Wasserstein\\ndistance to the matching degree between two sentences\\nin terms of character and word, respectively [44].\\n• CNNchar and\\nCNNword: They utilize a CNN to encode\\ntwo sentences for their corresponding sentence repre-\\nsentations, which are then concatenated to predict the\\nmatching degree with a softmax classiﬁer [44].\\n• BiLSTMchar and BiLSTMword: They are similar with the\\nformer CNN method replacing CNN by a BiLSTM\\ncomponent [44].\\nSecond, more advanced networks with relations or standard\\nBi-Attention-based context are compared with TAN embedded\\nwith Tri-Attention mechanism:\\nMethods\\nR10@1\\nR10@2\\nR10@5\\nTF-IDF\\n41.0\\n54.5\\n70.8\\nRNN\\n40.3\\n54.7\\n81.9\\nCNN\\n54.9\\n68.4\\n89.6\\nLSTM\\n63.8\\n78.4\\n94.9\\nSMN\\n72.6\\n84.7\\n96.1\\nDUA\\n75.2\\n86.8\\n96.2\\nDAM\\n76.7\\n87.4\\n96.9\\nIoI\\n79.6\\n89.4\\n97.4\\nESIM\\n79.6\\n89.4\\n97.5\\nMSN\\n80.0\\n89.9\\n97.8\\nBERT\\n80.8\\n89.7\\n97.5\\nRoBERTa-SS-DA\\n82.6\\n90.9\\n97.8\\nBERT-DPT\\n85.1\\n92.4\\n98.4\\nBERT-VFT\\n85.5\\n92.8\\n98.5\\nSA-BERT\\n85.5\\n92.8\\n98.3\\nUMSBERT+\\n87.5\\n94.2\\n98.8\\nBERT-SL\\n88.4\\n94.6\\n99.0\\nBERT-UMS+FGC\\n88.6\\n94.8\\n99.0\\nTANTAdd\\n90.5\\n95.8\\n99.2\\n(±0.3)\\n(±0.06)\\n(±0.05)\\nTANTDP\\n90.3\\n95.9\\n99.3\\n(±0.1)\\n(±0.3)\\n(±0.06)\\nTANTSDP\\n90.6\\n95.7\\n99.2\\n(±0.3)\\n(±0.05)\\n(±0.04)\\nTANTrili\\n90.1\\n95.7\\n99.3\\n(±0.08)\\n(±0.09)\\n(±0.04)\\nTABLE V: Retrieval-based dialogue: Experimental results on\\nthe Ubuntu Corpus V1 corpus. The values associated with ± in\\nbrackets are standard deviation. Mean and standard deviation\\nresults are averaged over ﬁve runs of each model. Four\\nTAN variants of different tensor operation-based Tri-Attention\\nmechanisms: TAdd - T-Additive, TDP - T-Dot-Product, TSDP\\n- T-Scaled-Dot-Product, and Trili - Trilinear.\\n• BiMPMchar and BiMPMword: They employ bilateral multi-\\nperspective matching to determine the semantic consis-\\ntency between sentences; BiLSTM learns sentence repre-\\nsentation, matches two sentences from multi-perspectives,\\naggregates the matching results, and makes prediction by\\na dense layer [65].\\n• MSEM: A connected graph describes the relations be-\\ntween sentences and realizes a neural architecture for\\nmulti-task learning including both sentence matching and\\nclassiﬁcation [66].\\n• GMN: A neural graph matching network is fed with all\\npossible segmentation paths to form word lattice graphs\\nand learns graph-based representations of sentences [42].\\n• COIN: A cross-attention mechanism combines contextual\\ninformation aligning sequences, with aligned representa-\\ntions interpolated by a gate fusion layer [13].\\n• 3DSSM: A 3D CNN captures temporal and multi-granular\\nfeatures of sentences and generates matching representa-\\ntion [21].\\nLastly, we compare TAN to several pretrained neural lan-\\nguage networks:\\n• BERT-Chinese: A Chinese BERT model [50].\\n• BERT-wwm: A Chinese BERT with an entire word mask-\\ning mechanism during pretraining [67].\\n• BERT-wwm-ext: A variant of BERT-wwm with more\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n10\\ntraining data and steps [67].\\n• ERNIE: It learns language representation enhanced by\\nknowledge masking strategies and entity- and phrase-\\nlevel masking [68].\\n• K-BERT: A model enhances BERT with HowNet by\\nintroducing soft position and visible matrix during ﬁne-\\ntuning and inference phases [69].\\n• GMN-BERT: A neural graph matching network with\\nmulti-granular input information [42].\\n2) TAN Settings: The TAN with Tri-Attention mechanism\\nis customized for sentence semantic matching. Its architecture\\nis composed of four core modules as shown in Fig. 3.\\nCompared to the TAN variant for retrieval-based dialogue, the\\nﬁltering module is not necessary. This is because the ﬁltering\\nmodule trims too long sequences, while the sequence length\\nin this task is acceptable. Since the input of sentence semantic\\nmatching consists of only two sentences, the contextual feature\\nrepresentation is learned by feeding connected results of\\nquestion and answer into BERTn [42].\\n3) Performance Evaluation: The results of TAN for sen-\\ntence semantic matching compared with all baseline models\\nare shown in Table VI. We obtain the following observations.\\nFirst, TAN signiﬁcantly outperforms all non-attention clas-\\nsic methods, similar to that for retrieval-based dialogue. The\\nclassic networks are unable to effectively capture latent seman-\\ntic information and complex interaction patterns. In contrast,\\nour Tri-Attention-based TAN combines the advantages of\\npretrained language model with contextual attention.\\nSecond, TAN also beats advanced networks with interac-\\ntion or Bi-Attention mechanism. Similar to retrieval-based\\ndialogue, TAN gains advantages from the prior knowledge\\nlearned by the pretrained model on large-scale corpus and\\ncontextual attention captured by Tri-Attention.\\nFurther, TAN performs better than pretrained BERT vari-\\nants. The BERT variants including BERT-wwm, BERT-wwm-\\next and ERNIE were trained on large data with more subtle\\ntraining techniques. In contrast, TAN outperforms these base-\\nlines without the involvement of large data or speciﬁc training\\ntechniques. This means that TAN not only outperforms these\\npowerful BERT variants in terms of accuracy and F1-score but\\nalso involves less training costs. Additionally, both K-BERT\\nand GMN-BERT are the latest BERT variants for sentence\\nsemantic matching. Their performance is still inferior to the\\nbest results of TANTAdd and TANTSDP.\\nLastly, TANTAdd, TANTDP, and TANTSDP outperform all\\nbaselines in terms of accuracy, and TANTAdd and TANTSDP\\nachieve better performance than baselines in terms of F1-score.\\nThese results verify the effectiveness of our model. TAN builds\\non BERT by replacing its self-attention mechanism with Tri-\\nAttention mechanism, whose four similarity implementations\\nmake 1-2% improvement in terms of accuracy compared to\\nthe original BERT. This indicates the Tri-Attention mechanism\\nplays a core role in making TAN better than BERT, i.e., beating\\nthe standard Bi-Attention mechanism.\\nE.

Mean and standard deviation results are\\naveraged over ﬁve runs of each model.\\nevaluate this in terms of three sets of baselines: single models,\\nensemble models, and pretrained lanaguage neural networks.\\n1) Baseline Methods: First, we compare TAN with single\\nmodel-based methods:\\n• Stanford AR: The standard Bi-Attention mechanism ob-\\ntains the question-related passage representation, which\\nis then coupled with a candidate option to obtain the\\nrelevance score [45].\\n• GA Reader: A gated attention mechanism captures the\\npassage information related to a problem, which is cou-\\npled with candidate options [45].\\n• ElimiNet: An elimination gate discards irrelevant options,\\nreﬁnes passage representations, and selects the most\\nsuitable option by a selection module [70].\\n• HAF: A hierarchical attention mechanism captures the\\ninteractions between passages, questions and candidate\\noptions [71].\\n• MUSIC: It dynamically applies different matching strate-\\ngies to different questions and applies a multi-hop rea-\\nsoning method to reach the right answer [72].\\n• Hier-Co-Matching: A co-matching strategy matches a\\npassage to a question and a passage to a candidate answer,\\nand then leverages a hierarchical LSTM to encode co-\\nmatching states for the relevance representation [73].\\nSecond, we compare TAN with ensemble models:\\n• GA Reader (6-ensemble): An ensemble method based on\\nmulti-hop gated attention mechanism between passages\\nand questions [45].\\n• ElimiNet (6-ensemble): An ensemble method with a\\nmulti-hop mechanism eliminates candidate answers [70].\\n• GA + ElimiNet (12-ensemble): It integrates GA Reader\\n(6-ensemble) and ElimiNet (6-ensemble) [74].\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n11\\n• Dynamic Fusion Network (9-ensemble): An ensemble\\nmodel based on multi-strategy inference for a compre-\\nhension architecture [72].\\n• CSA Model + ELMo (9-ensemble): It integrates spatial\\nconvolution attention mechanism with pretrained lan-\\nguage model ELMo [74].\\nLastly, we compare TAN with pretrained language models:\\n• BERTbase: It is the most commonly used pretrained lan-\\nguage model structure [50].\\n• BERTbase + DCMN: A reading comprehension model\\nbased on BERTbase and a dual co-matching network\\nmechanism [6].\\n2) TAN Settings:\\nWe here customize TAN with Tri-\\nAttention for machine reading comprehension. As shown in\\nFig. 3, its model architecture is similar to that of retrieval-\\nbased dialogue. However, this task involves three input se-\\nquences. Similar to sentence semantic matching, contextual\\nfeature representation is obtained by feeding the concatenation\\nof question, answer, and passage representations into BERTn.\\n3) Performance Evaluation: The results of TAN with Tri-\\nAttention for machine reading comprehension in comparison\\nwith all baselines are reported in Table VII. Again, TAN\\nwith Tri-Attention outperforms most baselines, verifying their\\neffectiveness.\\nFirst, TAN signiﬁcantly outperforms all single-model-based\\nmethods. This is probably because these single models have a\\nsingle structure which cannot model the semantic information\\nwithin a text and the semantic relations between texts. TAN\\nembedded with a pretrained language model and contextual\\nattention shows their empower.\\nSecond, our approach is clearly superior to all ensem-\\nble ones. The ﬁrst four ensemble models: GA Reader (6-\\nensemble), ElimiNet (6-ensemble), GA + ElimiNet (12-\\nensemble), and Dynamic Fusion Network (9-ensemble), do\\nnot apply pre-training, which may be the main reason for\\ntheir low performance. The last ensemble model CSA Model\\n+ ELMo (9-ensemble) utilizes the pretrained language model\\nELMo [75] to enhance its performance. Although this model\\nhas been greatly improved compared with the previous four\\nmodels, its performance is still much lower than TAN. This\\nmay be due to two reasons: the advantage of pretrained BERT\\nin our model and the contextual enhancement by Tri-Attention.\\nLastly, similar to the above conclusions in other tasks,\\nTAN with pretrained BERT beats the original BERT with\\nself-attention by explicitly capturing contextual interactions\\nwith queries and keys. Speciﬁcally, the TAN with additive\\nTri-Attention similarity slightly outperform BERTbase+DCMN,\\nwhich is speciﬁc for machine reading comprehension and\\nrelies on strategies and skills used by humans to complete\\nreading comprehension tasks. In contrast, as a general attention\\nmechanism, TAN and Tri-Attention are applicable to machine\\nreading comprehension and other NLP tasks.\\nF. Bi-Attention vs Tri-Attention Comparison\\nHere, we further evaluate the effectiveness of Tri-Attention.\\nTwo sets of comparisons are undertaken.

The second compares Tri-Attention with a\\ncommonly used contextual attention enhancement method in\\nthe literature to show the need for capturing explicit query-\\nkey-context interactions. As the RACE data costs too much\\ntime on running a full set of experiments, we here report the\\nresults on LCQMC and the Ubuntu Corpus V1 corpus.\\n1) Effectiveness: Bi-Attention vs Tri-Attention Mechanisms:\\nWe evaluate the different effect of the Bi-Attention without\\ncontextual information versus the Tri-Attention with context\\nin the same network structure. The experimental results are\\nshown in Table VIII. Bi-Attention mechanism does not involve\\ncontextual information in measuring the interactions. Its other\\nparts are the same as Tri-Attention. We report the results of\\nthese two attention mechanisms under four relevance scoring\\noperations: TAdd, TDP, TSDP, and Trili, respectively.\\nOverall, the results show that the Tri-Attention variants\\nconsistently outperform the counterparts without context. This\\ncorroborates the contribution of Tri-Attention with context,\\neven though the performance varies over different relevance\\nscoring functions.\\nSpeciﬁcally, on LCQMC, the difference between Bi-\\nAttention and Tri-Attention mechanisms shows the greatest\\nunder trilinear operation. Tri-Attention gains extra 1.03%\\naccuracy and 0.76% F1-score over Bi-Attention, respectively.\\nFor the Ubuntu Corpus V1 corpus, the greatest difference is\\nassociated with SDP, where Tri-Attention makes 0.8%, 0.2%,\\nand 0.1% improvement in terms of evaluation metrics R10@1,\\nR10@2, and R10@5, respectively.\\n2) Necessity: Contextual Query-Key Interactions vs Query-\\nKey-Context Interactions: As discussed in Section II, some\\nexisting methods also involve contextual information, typically\\nby simple addition or concatenation to target representations.\\nHere, we evaluate the difference of this way from our ap-\\nproaches in Tri-Attention which involves context equivalently\\nto other query and key entities in the attention learning.\\nWe generate a Bi-Attention variant to realize a contextual\\nattention enhancement method commonly used in the existing\\nJOURNAL OF LATEX CLASS FILES, VOL. 14, NO. 8, AUGUST 2015\\n12\\nMethods\\nLCQMC\\nUbuntu Corpus V1 Corpus\\nAccuracy\\nF1-score\\nR10@1\\nR10@2\\nR10@5\\nTri-AttentionTAdd\\n87.49 (±0.47)\\n87.95 (±0.27)\\n90.5 (±0.3)\\n95.8 (±0.06)\\n99.2 (±0.05)\\nBi-AttentionAdd\\n86.77 (±0.28)\\n87.37 (±0.16)\\n89.9 (±0.4)\\n95.5 (±0.2)\\n99.2 (±0.09)\\nTri-AttentionTDP\\n87.25 (±0.11)\\n87.83 (±0.06)\\n90.3 (±0.1)\\n95.9 (±0.3)\\n99.3 (±0.06)\\nBi-AttentionDP\\n86.52 (±0.09)\\n87.20 (±0.06)\\n89.8 (±0.2)\\n95.5 (±0.1)\\n99.2 (±0.04)\\nTri-AttentionTSDP\\n87.23 (±0.58)\\n87.80 (±0.29)\\n90.6 (±0.3)\\n95.7 (±0.05)\\n99.2 (±0.04)\\nBi-AttentionSDP\\n86.61 (±0.09)\\n87.29 (±0.04)\\n89.8 (±0.3)\\n95.5 (±0.2)\\n99.1 (±0.05)\\nTri-AttentionTrili\\n86.72 (±0.05)\\n87.38 (±0.02)\\n90.1 (±0.08)\\n95.7 (±0.09)\\n99.3 (±0.04)\\nBi-AttentionBili\\n85.84 (±0.11)\\n86.72 (±0.06)\\n89.7 (±0.09)\\n95.5 (±0.1)\\n99.2 (±0.03)\\nTABLE VIII:\\nResults of effectiveness of Bi-Attention vs Tri-Attention mechanisms on LCQMC and Ubuntu Corpus V1\\nCorpus.

Means and standard deviations are averaged over ﬁve runs.\\nwork. The contextual information is added (with addition)\\nto each sequence separately to obtain a contextual sequence\\nrepresentation. Then, the context-enhanced sequence repre-\\nsentations interact using the standard query-key Bi-Attention\\nmechanism, whose other network settings are consistent with\\nTri-Attention. This forms the commonly used contextual at-\\ntention in the literature, abbreviated C-BiAttention.\\nThe experimental results are shown in Table IX. It shows\\nthat the performance of C-BiAttention consistently under-\\nperforms than Tri-Attention with all four relevance calcu-\\nlators. C-BiAttention with the dot-product-based relevance\\ncalculator achieves the lowest performance. On LCQMC, C-\\nBiAttention reduces 1.52% accuracy and 1.17% F1-score over\\nTri-Attention, respectively. Similarly, on the Ubuntu Corpus\\nV1 corpus, the highest performance degradation is with the\\nAdditive-based approach. In comparison with Tri-Attention,\\nC-BiAttention decreases 0.4% R10@1, 0.1% R10@2, respec-\\ntively. This experiment veriﬁes that the explicit query-key-\\ncontext interactions in Tri-Attention outperforms the simple\\ncontextual attention by adding or concatenating contextual\\ninformation to underlying sequences. It also conﬁrms the\\nnecessity of learning query-key-context interactions in Tri-\\nAttention.\\nG. Hyperparameter Analysis: Tri-Attention Layers\\nTAN in Fig. 3 is a stackable structure, where the number\\nof Tri-Attention layers can be dynamically adjusted according\\nto learning tasks. In addition, In addition, different relevance\\nscore calculation methods in Eqs. (10)-(13) also affect the\\nnumber of Tri-Attention layers for a learning task. We thus\\ntest the effect of the number of Tri-Attention layers.\\nFig. 4 - 6 show the experimental results of retrieval-based\\ndialogue, sentence semantic matching, and machine reading\\ncomprehension tasks on Ubuntu Corpus V1, LCQMC, and\\nRACE, respectively. The best performance of Tri-Attention\\ncorresponds to different relevance score calculation methods\\nfor different tasks. This indicates that, when applying Tri-\\nAttention to a special task, all four relevance calculation\\nmethods should be tried before achieving the best result. In\\naddition, the number of Tri-Attention layers depends on the\\nrelevance calculation methods and learning tasks. Thus, when\\napplied to a speciﬁc task, the best number of Tri-Attention\\nlayers needs to be tuned for each relevance calculation method.\\nH. TAN Case Study\\nLastly, we illustrate the prediction results of TAN with Tri-\\nAttention on the LCQMC data for sentence semantic matching.\\nWe only illustrate the additive-based relevance calculation for\\nTri-Attention as the previous experiments show its better sta-\\nbility. We reapply the three variants used in Section VI-F: Tri-\\nAttentionAdd, Bi-AttentionAdd and C-BiAttentionAdd, respec-\\ntively. To verify the advantages of Tri-Attention, the prediction\\nresults of all three models were statistically analyzed.\\nSpeciﬁcally, we conduct a statistical analysis when only\\nTri-Attention makes correct prediction while the other two\\nmodels predict incorrectly. In the test set of LCQMC, there are\\n151 pieces of data conforming to the above situation, among\\nwhich 49 pieces are positive and 102 pieces are negative. This\\nsuggests that Tri-Attention is better at identifying negative\\ndata. The instance in Table X illustrates the result.\\nFor both S1 and S2, the gold label is 0, which means that\\ntheir meanings are different.

Since there are\\nmany overlap words in S1 and S2, if a model judges the\\nrelations between these two sentences only on the basis of\\nword-level relevance without the contextual information, it\\nis easy to be misled and draw a wrong conclusion. This\\nprobably explains why the Bi-AttentionAdd method fails to\\ncorrectly predict the relation between S1 and S2. As for C-\\nBiAttentionAdd, although it also involves context, its contextual\\ninformation does not participate in the interaction with queries\\nand keys, thus making no direct impact on the relevance\\nscore between sentences. While Tri-Attention directly involves\\ncontext in the interactions between sentences, contributing to\\nbetter prediction.\\nVII. CONCLUSIONS\\nContextual information has shown essential in many learn-\\ning tasks. The great success of attention mechanisms does\\nnot necessarily involves contextual information. In neural\\nNLP, increasing work on contextual attention learning typi-\\ncally concatenates contextual features into underlying targets\\nsuch as sequences, then the standard query-key-based Bi-\\nAttention mechanisms calculate relevance scores on the to-\\nkenized contextual sequence representations. In this paper, a\\nnovel query-key-context-interactive Tri-Attention mechanism\\nexplicitly captures the interactions between query, key and\\ncontext. We derive four query-key-context relevance calcu-\\nlation methods for Tri-Attention using tensor algebraic tech-\\nniques. Intensive experiments on different NLP tasks show\\nthat Tri-Attention-based networks can serve as a general\\nattention framework, which outperforms most state-of-the-art\\nnon-attention, standard Bi-Attention, contextual Bi-Attention,\\nand pretrained language models with attention. Our future\\nwork includes evaluating Tri-Attention in other NLP tasks and\\nTri-Attention without pretrained BERT, and exploring more\\neffective tensor algebraic implementations for for interactions\\nwith n > 3 factors.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] K.

We also observe that skipping layers except\\nthe latter layers reduces performances for more\\nlayers skipped, except for skipping the attention\\nlayers.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe ubiquitous deployment of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) results in ever-growing amounts of compute spent\\non inference (Patterson et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Kad-\\ndour et al., 2023a; Xia et al., 2024; Reid et al., 2024). Fur-\\nther, serving models with low latencies remains challenging\\nbecause contemporary Transformer architectures employ\\nthe self-attention mechanism with quadratic input complex-\\nity (Touvron et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we delve deeper into the concept of layer\\nskipping (Fan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022a) to reduce\\nthe computation on superfluous LLM components. Our\\nfindings demonstrate that pruning deeper attention layers\\ndoes not significantly affect performance. When applied\\nto Llama-v2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we maintain good\\nperformance on the OpenLLM (ARC (Clark et al., 2018),\\n*Equal contribution\\n1University College London,\\nUK\\n2University of Edinburgh, UK.

Layer skipping\\nConsider a Transformer model M with L layers, each\\nconsisting of an attention sub-layer followed by a multi-\\nlayer perceptron (MLP) sub-layer. We denote each layer as\\nMi = (Attentioni, MLPi) for i ∈{1, 2, . . . , L}.\\nTo compare the performance of Transformer models when\\nskipping specific sub-layers, we create two variants of the\\nmodel:\\n1. Skipping MLP Layers: We construct a model Mskip MLP\\n1\\narXiv:2407.15516v1  [cs.LG]  22 Jul 2024\\nAttention Is All You Need But You Don’t Need All Of It\\nby skipping the MLP sub-layer from the last k layers. The\\nresulting model is Mskip MLP = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(Attentioni, ∅) | i ∈{L −k +\\n1, . . . , L}}.\\n2. Skipping Attention Layers: We construct a model\\nMskip Attention by skipping the attention sub-layer from the\\nlast k layers.\\nThe resulting model is Mskip Attention =\\n{(Attentioni, MLPi)\\n|\\ni\\n∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪\\n{(∅, MLPi) | i ∈{L −k + 1, . . . , L}}.\\n3.

The re-\\nsulting model is Mskip Block = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(∅) | i ∈{L −k + 1, . . . , L}}.\\nWe then evaluate the performance of these modified models\\non the OpenLLM benchmark (Beeching et al., 2023), com-\\nparing metrics such as accuracy, computational efficiency,\\nand memory usage. This comparison helps in understand-\\ning the individual contributions of the attention and MLP\\nsub-layers to the overall performance of the Transformer\\nmodel.\\n(a) Skip attention lay-\\ners.\\n(b) Skip attention lay-\\ners,\\nkeep last full\\nblock.\\n(c) Skip ffwd layers.\\n(d) Skip ffwd layers,\\nkeep last full block.\\n(e) Skip full blocks.\\n(f) Skip full blocks,\\nkeep last full block.\\nFigure 2. Skip mechanisms for skipping single layers and entire\\nTransformer blocks (ffwd and attention layers) during inference.\\n2.2. Motivation: Are Deeper Layers More Redundant?\\nIn Transformer models, the last layers have been shown to\\ncontribute less information than earlier layers, making it\\npossible to drop those layers at a minimal performance cost\\n(Fan et al., 2019; Zhang & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022a;\\nSchuster et al., 2022; Kaddour et al., 2023b; Belrose et al.,\\n2023).\\nTo verify this, we experiment with removing either the at-\\ntention sublayers or the MLP sublayers. Figure 1 shows the\\ncosine similarities between a layer’s features and the previ-\\nous layer showing that deeper layers have a lower impact\\non the features than earlier layers. One notable exception\\nto this trend is that the last layer for both Llama-v2 7B and\\n13B has the lowest cosine similarity with the previous layer.\\nPrevious analysis of the attention mechanism has shown\\nthat they can converge to the same value due to attention\\ncollapse (Zhai et al., 2023) and token features that also con-\\nverge to the same value due to over-smoothing (Wang et al.,\\n2022b; Dovonon et al., 2024) or rank collapse (Dong et al.,\\n2023), with solutions to these issues typically improving\\nperformance (Ali et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2024).\\n3. Results\\nExperimental Setup\\nFor all experiments, we use either\\nLlama-v2-7B or Llama-v2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a;b),\\ntwo LLMs trained on trillions of publically available tokens.\\nWe experiment with keeping 66%, 75%, 90% and 100% of\\nthe network and report the corresponding results in Table 1.\\nWe also experiment with removing attention sublayers in\\nTable 2, MLP sublayers in Table 3, and a varying number of\\nlayers similar to Table 1 but keeping the last layer in Table 4.\\n3.1.

This is even more\\nexaggerated compared to just dropping layers, including the\\nlast one. The reason for this could be attributed to the (lack\\nof) robustness of feedforward sublayers, as the last layer\\nnow has to process perturbed information from earlier lay-\\ners. For future work, it would be interesting to see if these\\nperformance drops can be compensated by a small amount\\nTable 5.

Related Work\\nEarly Exit during inference\\nEarly exit methods have also\\nbeen proposed in other domains (Graves, 2017; Teerapit-\\ntayanon et al., 2017) before getting adapted to autoregressive\\nmodels (Elbayad et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2022; Din et al.,\\n2023; Elhoushi et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\\n2024). The idea works by dynamically allocating compute\\nbased on the difficulty of the input sequence. Our method\\nprunes the deepest layers and does not involve any level of\\nadaptability. This is beneficial because it does not require\\nthe entire model to be loaded in memory. Dropping layers\\nduring inference has been done on BERT-like models in\\n(Wang et al., 2022a; Sajjad et al., 2023). We apply a similar\\nanalysis to more recent LLMs and study the impact of skip-\\nping attention and/or MLP layers in more detail. Concurrent\\nwork to ours by Gromov et al. (2024) yields similar results\\nby pruning deeper layers and applying fine-tuning on the\\npruned model.\\nLayer dropping/growing during training\\nThere are var-\\nious works studying the dropping/growing layers dynami-\\ncally during training (Fan et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019;\\nKaddour et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). In\\ncontrast, this work focuses on dropping layers of an already\\npre-trained model in a way similar to Men et al. (2024).\\nOther Inference Speedup Methods\\nOther works to speed\\nup inference include compressing KV caches (Nawrot et al.,\\n2024; Wu & Tu, 2024; Bi et al., 2024), speculative decoding\\n(Chen et al., 2023), efficient memory management (Kwon\\net al., 2023), or subqudratic attention architectures (Fu et al.,\\n2022; Peng et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2023), an overview has\\nbeen provided by Kaddour et al. (2023a).\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe investigated the effect of dropping the last layers from\\nthe 7B and 13B Llama2 models. We observe that dropping\\nattention sublayers lead to much lower drops in performance\\nthan dropping the MLP sublayers, whether the last layer\\nis included or not, while also leading to better inference\\nspeedups. For example, removing 33% of attention layers\\nleads to an 18% speedup in a 13B Llama2 model at the cost\\nof a 1.8% drop in average performance. This shows that\\nmassive improvements can be made over dropping entire\\nlayers from just dropping the attention sublayer.\\nReferences\\nAli, A., Galanti, T., and Wolf, L.

Introduction\\nInstance-level image retrieval is at the core of visual rep-\\nresentation learning and is connected with many problems\\nof visual recognition and machine learning, for instance\\nmetric learning [30, 26], few-shot learning [42] and unsu-\\npervised learning [8]. Many large-scale open datasets [3,\\n37, 16, 29, 53], and competitions1 have accelerated progress\\nin instance-level image retrieval, which has been trans-\\nformed by deep learning [3].\\nMany studies on instance-level image retrieval focus\\non learning features from convolutional neural networks\\n(CNN), while others focus on re-ranking, for instance by\\ngraph-based methods [11]. The former can be distinguished\\naccording to feature types: local descriptors, reminiscent of\\nSIFT [27], where an image is mapped to a few hundred vec-\\ntors; and global descriptors, where an image is mapped to a\\n1https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020\\nsingle vector. In fact, deep learning has brought global de-\\nscriptors with astounding performance, while allowing efﬁ-\\ncient search. Our study belongs to this type.\\nStudies on global descriptors have focused on spatial\\npooling [2, 37]. The need for compact, discriminative rep-\\nresentations that are resistant to clutter has naturally given\\nrise to spatial attention methods [24, 28]. Different kinds\\nof attention have been studied in many areas of computer\\nvision research. There is also channel attention [20, 9]; lo-\\ncal attention, applied independently to elements of the rep-\\nresentation (feature map) [54, 25]; global attention, based\\non interaction between elements [52, 9]; and combinations\\nthereof. Unfortunately, each study has been limited to one or\\ntwo kinds of attention only; attention is not always learned;\\nand applications vary.\\nIt is the objective of our work to perform a compre-\\nhensive study of all forms of attention above, apply them\\nto instance-level image retrieval and provide a detailed ac-\\ncount of their interaction and impact on performance. As\\nshown in Figure 1, we collect contextual information from\\nimages with both local and global attention, giving rise to\\ntwo parallel network streams. Importantly, each operates\\non both spatial locations and feature channels. Local at-\\ntention is about individual locations and channels; global is\\nabout interaction between locations and between channels.\\nThe extracted information is separately embedded in local\\nand global attention feature maps, which are combined in a\\nglobal-local attention feature map before pooling.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We propose a novel network that consists of both\\nglobal and local attention for image retrieval. This is\\nthe ﬁrst study that employs both mechanisms.\\n2. Each of the global and local attention mechanisms\\ncomprises both spatial and channel attention.\\n3. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical\\nevidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and\\nimprove the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n1\\narXiv:2107.08000v1  [cs.CV]  16 Jul 2021\\nAl\\nc\\nc × 1 × 1\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\nc\\nAl\\ns\\n1 × h × w\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\n×\\nc × h × w\\nF\\n×\\n+\\nc × h × w\\nFgl\\nAg\\nc\\nc × c\\n×\\nFg\\nc\\nAg\\ns\\nhw × hw\\n×\\n+\\nFg\\n×\\nwl\\nw\\nwg\\nchannel attention\\nspatial attention\\nfusion\\nlocal attention\\nglobal attention\\nFigure 1: Our global-local attention module (GLAM) involves both channel and spatial attention, as well as both local atten-\\ntion (channels/locations weighted independently, based on contextual information obtained by pooling) and global attention\\n(based on pairwise interaction between channels/locations).

The input feature map F is weighted into local (Fl) and\\nglobal (Fg) attention feature maps, which are fused with F to yield the global-local attention feature map Fgl.

Related work\\nInstance-level image retrieval\\nStudies on instance-level\\nimage retrieval can be roughly, but not exclusively, di-\\nvided into three types: (1) studies on global descriptors\\n[3, 16, 24, 53, 2, 37]; (2) studies on local descriptors and\\ngeometry-based re-ranking [29, 45, 40, 53]; (3) re-ranking\\nby graph-based methods [11, 21, 55]. The ﬁrst two types\\nof studies focus on the feature representation, while the last\\ntype focuses on re-ranking extracted features.\\nStudies on global descriptors focus on spatial pooling\\nof CNN feature maps into vectors, including MAC [38],\\nSPoC [2], CroW [24], R-MAC [48, 15, 16], GeM [37],\\nand NetVLAD [1, 25], as well as learning the representa-\\ntion [3, 15, 16, 36, 37]. Studies before deep learning dom-\\ninated image retrieval were mostly based on local descrip-\\ntors like SIFT [27] and bag-of-words representation [32] or\\naggregated descriptors like VLAD [22] or ASMK [46]. Lo-\\ncal descriptors have been revived in deep learning, e.g. with\\nDELF [29], DELG [5] and ASMK extensions [45, 47].\\nWe focus on learning a global descriptor in this work, be-\\ncause it is the most efﬁcient in terms of storage and search.\\nHowever, our generic attention mechanism produces a fea-\\nture tensor and could be applicable to local descriptors as\\nwell, if global pooling were replaced by local feature detec-\\ntion. Re-ranking methods are complementary to the repre-\\nsentation and we do not consider them in this work.\\nAttention\\nAttention mechanisms have been ﬁrst proposed\\nin image classiﬁcation studies focusing on channel at-\\nMETHOD\\nLOCAL\\nGLOBAL\\nLRN RET\\nSpatial Channel Spatial Channel\\nSENet [20]\\n✓\\n✓\\nECA-Net [51]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGCNet [6]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCBAM [54]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nGE [19]\\n✓\\n✓\\nNL-Net [52]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAA-Net [4]\\n✓\\n✓\\nSAN [59]\\n✓\\n✓\\nN3Net [34]\\n✓\\n✓\\nA2-Net [9]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGSoP [14]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOnA [23]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAGeM [17]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCroW [24]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nCRN [25]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELF [29]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELG [5]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nTolias et al.

CRN [25] ap-\\nplies spatial attention for feature reweighting and is learned.\\nLearned spatial attention mechanisms are common for local\\ndescriptors [29, 5, 47].\\nWe call the above methods local attention, in the sense\\nthat elements of the feature tensor (channels / spatial loca-\\ntions), are weighted independently, based on contextual in-\\nformation obtained by pooling or learned. By constrast, by\\nglobal attention we refer to mechanisms that model inter-\\naction between elements of the feature tensor, for example\\nbetween channels or between locations.\\nIn image classiﬁcation, non-local neural network (NL-\\nNet) [52] is maybe the ﬁrst global attention mechanism, fol-\\nlowed by similar studies [4, 59, 34]. It is global spatial at-\\ntention, allowing interaction between any pair of spatial lo-\\ncations. Similarly, there are studies of global channel atten-\\ntion, allowing interaction between channels [9, 14]. Global\\nattention has focused mostly on image recognition and has\\nbeen applied to either spatial or channel attention so far, not\\nboth. In image retrieval, SOLAR [28] is a direct application\\nof the global spatial attention mechanism of [52].\\nTable 1 attempts to categorize related work on atten-\\ntion according to whether attention is local or global, spa-\\ntial or channel, whether it is learned and whether it is ap-\\nplied to instance-level image retrieval. We observe that all\\nmethods limit to one or two forms of attention only. Of\\nthose studies that focus on image retrieval, many are not\\nlearned [23, 17, 24], and of those that are, some are de-\\nsigned for local descriptors [29, 47].\\nBy contrast, we provide a comprehensive study of all\\nforms of attention, global and local, spatial and channel, to\\nobtain a learned representation in the form of a tensor that\\ncan be used in any way. We spatially pool it into a global\\ndescriptor and we study the relative gain of different forms\\nof attention in image retrieval.\\nfeature map\\nconv 1 × 1\\nconv 3 × 3\\nconv 5 × 5\\nconv 7 × 7\\nconcat\\nconv 1 × 1\\nattention map\\nc × h × w\\n4c′ × h × w\\n1 × h × w\\nc′ × h × w\\ndilated\\nconv\\nF\\nF′\\nAl\\ns\\nFigure 3: Local spatial attention.

Global-local attention\\nWe design a global-local attention module (GLAM),\\nwhich is attached at the end of a backbone network. Figure 1\\nillustrates its main components. We are given a c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F, where c is the number of channels, and\\nh × w is the spatial resolution. Local attention collects con-\\ntext from the image and applies pooling to obtain a c×1×1\\nlocal channel attention map Al\\nc and a 1 × h × w local spa-\\ntial attention map Al\\ns. Global attention allows interaction\\nbetween channels, resulting in a c × c global channel at-\\ntention map Ag\\nc, and between spatial locations, resulting in\\na hw × hw global spatial attention map Ag\\ns. The feature\\nmaps produced by the two attention streams are combined\\nwith the original one by a learned fusion mechanism into\\nthe global-local attention feature map Fgl before being spa-\\ntially pooled into a global image descriptor.\\n3.1. Local attention\\nWe extract an 1D channel and a 2D spatial attention map\\nto weigh the feature map in the corresponding dimensions.\\nLocal channel attention\\nFollowing ECA-Net [51], this\\nattention captures local channel information. As shown in\\nFigure 2, we are given a c×h×w feature tensor F from our\\nbackbone. We ﬁrst reduce it to a c × 1 × 1 tensor by global\\naverage pooling (GAP). Channel attention is then captured\\nby a 1D convolution of kernel size k along the channel di-\\nmension, where k controls the extent of cross-channel inter-\\naction. This is followed by a sigmoid function, resulting in\\nthe c × 1 × 1 local channel attention map Al\\nc.\\nLocal spatial attention\\nInspired by the inception mod-\\nule [43] and similar to [25], this attention map captures local\\nspatial information at different scales.

We then extract local spatial\\ncontextual information using convolutional ﬁlters of kernel\\nsize 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7, which are efﬁciently imple-\\nmented by 3 × 3 dilated convolutions [7, 57] with dilation\\nparameter 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The resulting features,\\nalong with one obtained by 1 × 1 convolution on F′, are\\nconcatenated into a 4c′ × h × w tensor. Finally, we obtain\\nthe 1 × h × w local spatial attention map Al\\ns by a 1 × 1\\nconvolution that reduces the channel dimension to 1.\\nThe middle column of Figure 6 shows heat maps of local\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nLocal attention feature map\\nWe use the local channel\\nattention map Al\\nc to weigh F in the channel dimension\\nFl\\nc := F ⊙Al\\nc + F.\\n(1)\\nWe then use local spatial attention map Al\\ns to weigh Fl\\nc\\nin the spatial dimensions, resulting in the c × h × w local\\nattention feature map\\nFl = Fl\\nc ⊙Al\\ns + Fl\\nc.\\n(2)\\nHere, A⊙B denotes an element-wise multiplication of ten-\\nsors A and B, with broadcasting when one tensor is smaller.\\nWe adopt the choice of applying channel followed by spa-\\ntial attention from convolutional block attention module\\nCBAM [54]. However, apart from computing Al\\ns at differ-\\nent scales, both attention maps are obtained from the orig-\\ninal tensor F rather than sequentially. In addition, both (1)\\nand (2) include residual connections, while CBAM includes\\na single residual connection over both steps.\\n3.2.

This mechanism is based on the non-local neural net-\\nwork [52], but with the idea of 1D convolution from ECA-\\nNet [51]. As shown in Figure 4, we are given the c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F from our backbone. We apply GAP and\\nsqueeze spatial dimensions, followed by a 1D convolution\\nof kernel size k and a sigmoid function, to obtain 1×c query\\nQc and key Kc tensors. The value tensor Vc is obtained by\\nmere reshaping of F to hw×c, without GAP. Next, we form\\nthe outer product of Kc and Qc, followed by softmax over\\nchannels to obtain a c × c global channel attention map\\nAg\\nc = softmax(Kc\\n⊤Qc).\\n(3)\\nFinally, this attention map is multiplied with Vc and the ma-\\ntrix product VcAg\\nc is reshaped back to c×h×w to give the\\nglobal channel attention feature map Gc. In GSoP [14] and\\nA2-Net [9], a c×c global channel attention map is obtained\\nby multiplication of hw × c matrices; (3) is more efﬁcient,\\nusing only an outer product of 1 × c vectors.\\nGlobal spatial attention\\nSince ordinary convolution ap-\\nplies only a local neighborhood at a time, it cannot capture\\nglobal contextual information. Thus, we apply non-local ﬁl-\\ntering [52], which is a form of self-attention [49] in the spa-\\ntial dimensions. As shown in Figure 5, we are given the\\nsame c × h × w feature tensor F from our backbone. By\\nusing three 1×1 convolutions, which reduce channels to c′,\\nand ﬂattening spatial dimensions to hw, we obtain c′ × hw\\nquery Qs, key Ks, and value Vs tensors, where each col-\\numn is a feature vector corresponding to a particular spatial\\nlocation. We capture pairwise similarities of these vectors\\nby matrix multiplication of Ks and Qs, followed by soft-\\nmax over locations to obtain a hw × hw global spatial at-\\ntention map:\\nAg\\ns = softmax(K⊤\\ns Qs).\\n(4)\\n4\\nThis attention map is multiplied with Vs and the matrix\\nproduct VsAg\\ns is reshaped back to c′ ×h×w by expanding\\nthe spatial dimensions. Finally, using a 1 × 1 convolution,\\nwhich increases channels back to c, we obtain the c×h×w\\nglobal spatial attention feature map Gs.\\nThe right column of Figure 6 shows heat maps for global\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nGlobal attention feature map\\nWe use the global channel\\nattention feature map Fc to weigh F element-wise\\nFg\\nc = F ⊙Gc.\\n(5)\\nWe then use global spatial attention feature map Gs to\\nweigh Fg\\nc element-wise, resulting in the c × h × w global\\nattention feature map\\nFg = Fg\\nc ⊙Gs + Fg\\nc.\\n(6)\\nSimilarly to Fl in (1) and (2), we apply channel attention\\nﬁrst, followed by spatial attention. However, unlike (1),\\nthere is no residual connection in (5). This choice is sup-\\nported by early experiments.\\n3.3. Global-local attention\\nFeature fusion\\nAs shown in Figure 1, we combine the\\nlocal and global attention feature maps, Fl and Fg, with\\nthe original feature F. While concatenation and summation\\nare common operations for feature combination, we use a\\nweighted average with weights wl, wg, w respectively, ob-\\ntained by softmax over three learnable scalar parameters, to\\nobtain a c × h × w global-local attention feature map\\nFgl = wlFl + wgFl + wF.\\n(7)\\nEfﬁcientDet [44] has shown that this is the most effective,\\namong a number of choices, for fusion of features across\\ndifferent scales.\\nPooling\\nWe apply GeM [37], a learnable spatial pooling\\nmechanism, to feature map Fgl (7), followed by a fully-\\nconnected (FC) layer with dropout and batch normalization.\\nThe ﬁnal embedding is obtained by ℓ2-normalization.\\n4.

The clean datasets\\nfocus on views directly relevant to landmark recognition but\\nhave a much smaller number of images.\\nEvaluation set and metrics\\nWe use four common eval-\\nuation datasets for landmark image retrieval: Oxford5k\\n(Ox5k) [32], Paris6k (Par6k) [33], as well as Revisited Ox-\\nford (ROxford or ROxf) and Paris (RParis or RPar) [35].\\nROxford and RParis are used with and without one million\\ndistractors (R1M) [28] and evaluated using the Medium and\\nHard protocols [35]. We evaluate using mean Average Pre-\\ncision (mAP) and mean precision at 10 (mP@10).\\n4.2. Implementation details\\nWe train on 8 TITAN RTX 2080Ti GPUs. All models are\\npre-trained on ImageNet [39] and implemented in PyTorch\\n[31]. For fair comparisons, we set a training environment\\n5\\nFigure 7: Examples of our ranking results.

The kernel\\nsize k of ECANet in subsection 3.1 is set to 3. The param-\\neter p of GeM in subsection 3.3 is set to 3 and the dimen-\\nsion d of ﬁnal embeddings to 512. We adopt ArcFace [10],\\na cosine-softmax based loss, with a margin of 0.3. We use\\nstochastic gradient descent with initial learning rate 10−3,\\nmomentum 0.9 and weight decay 10−5.\\nWe adopt the batch sampling of Yokoo et al. [56] where\\nmini-batch samples with similar aspect ratios are resized to\\na particular size. Here, we use a batch size of 64. For image\\naugmentation, we apply scaling, random cropping, and var-\\nied illumination. At inference, we apply a multi-resolution\\nrepresentation [16] to query and database images.\\nOur method is denoted as GLAM (global-local atten-\\ntion module). Using the backbone model alone is referred\\nto as baseline. It is compatible with recent models based\\non ResNet101-GeM trained with ArcFace [53, 28]. Adding\\nour local attention (subsection 3.1) to the baseline model is\\ndenoted +local, while adding our global attention (subsec-\\ntion 3.2) is denoted +global. Since we focus on representa-\\ntion learning, we do not consider post-processing methods\\nlike geometry-based re-ranking [29, 40, 53] or graph-based\\nre-ranking [11, 21, 55].\\n4.3.

To achieve best possible performance, we use\\nGLDv2-clean as a training set in the remaining experiments.\\nComparisons on same training set\\nIt is common to com-\\npare methods regardless of training sets as more become\\navailable, e.g., [35, 28]. Since GLDv2-clean is relatively\\nnew, Weyand et al. [53], which introduced the dataset, is the\\nonly study that has trained the same backbone with the same\\nsettings (ResNet101-GeM with ArcFace) on GLDv2-clean.\\nOur baseline is lower than [53], because our dimensinality is\\n512, while other models based on ResNet101 use 2048. Yet,\\nTable 3 shows that our best model trained on GLDv2-clean\\noutperforms [53] by a large margin. But the most impor-\\ntant comparison is with SOLAR [28], also based on self-\\nattention, which has trained ResNet101-GeM on GLDv1-\\nnoisy. On this training set, our best model clearly outper-\\nforms [28] despite lower dimensionality.\\nComparison with state of the art\\nTable 4 shows the\\nperformance of four variants of our model, i.e. baseline\\nwith or without local/global attention, and compares them\\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on global de-\\nscriptors without re-ranking on the complete set of bench-\\nmarks, including distractors. Both local and global atten-\\ntion bring signiﬁcant gain over the baseline. The effect\\nof global is stronger, while the gain of the two is addi-\\ntive in the combination.

Table 5 shows the results, which are more ﬁne-\\ngrained than those of Table 4. In particular, it shows the ef-\\nfect of the channel and spatial variants of both local and\\nglobal attention. We observe that, when used alone, the\\nchannel and spatial variants of local attention are harmful\\nin most cases. Even the combination, baseline+local, is not\\nalways effective. By contrast, when used alone, the channel\\nand spatial variants of global attention are mostly beneﬁcial,\\nespecially the latter. Their combination, baseline+global, is\\nimpressive, bringing gain of up to 7.5%. Importantly, the\\ncombination baseline+global+local improves further by up\\nto another 2.8%. This result shows the necessity of local\\nattention in the ﬁnal model.\\nCBAM vs. our local spatial attention\\nWe experiment\\nwith the local spatial attention of CBAM [54]. CBAM ap-\\nplies average and max-pooling to input features and con-\\ncatenates the two for spatial attention. We apply this vari-\\nant to our local spatial attention module for comparison.\\nFor the CBAM style module, we keep the overall design\\nof our module as shown in Figure 3, but apply average and\\nmax-pooling to each of the four convolutional layer outputs\\nbefore concatenation. Table 6 shows that the CBAM style\\nmodule is considerably worse than ours on all benchmarks\\nexcept Paris6k, where it is only slightly better.\\nConcatenation vs. sum for feature fusion\\nWe use a\\nsoftmax-based weighted average of local and global atten-\\ntion feature maps with the original feature map (7). Here,\\nwe compare this weighted average with weighted concate-\\nnation, where concatenation replaces the sum operation\\nin (7). As shown in Table 7, the weighted average outper-\\nforms the weighted concatenation.\\nFixed-size vs. group-size sampling\\nNumerous studies\\nhave proposed methods for constructing batches according\\nto image size for efﬁcient training. For instance, Gordo et\\nal. [16], DELF [29], and Yokoo et al. [56] employed dif-\\nferent image sizes per batch for training instead of a single\\nﬁxed size. We adopt the method of Yokoo et al., which con-\\nstructs a batch with images of similar aspect ratio, so that\\nthe images can be resized to a size with an aspect ratio that\\nis similar to their own. We call this method group-size sam-\\npling. Table 8 compares ﬁxed-size (224 × 224) with group-\\nsize sampling. We observe that maintaining aspect ratios by\\nusing dynamic input sizes is much more effective.\\nMulti-resolution\\nWe use the multi-resolution representa-\\ntion [16] for the ﬁnal feature of an image at inference time.\\nThis method: (1) resizes an image into multiple scales; (2)\\nextracts features from the resized images; and (3) averages\\nthe features to obtain the ﬁnal feature of the image. The\\nmethod is applied to both query and database images to en-\\nhance ranking results, especially for small target objects.\\nTable 9 compares the four cases of applying this method or\\nnot to query or database images.\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe have introduced a novel approach that extracts global\\nand local contextual information using attention mecha-\\nnisms for instance-level image retrieval. It is manifested as\\na network architecture consisting of global and local atten-\\ntion components, each operating on both spatial and chan-\\nnel dimensions. This constitutes a comprehensive study and\\nempirical evaluation of all four forms of attention that have\\npreviously been studied only in isolation. Our ﬁndings indi-\\ncate that the gain (or loss) brought by one form of attention\\nalone strongly depends on the presence of the others, with\\nthe maximum gain appearing when all forms are present.\\nThe output is a modiﬁed feature tensor that can be used in\\nany way, for instance with local feature detection instead of\\nspatial pooling for image retrieval.\\nWith the advent of vision transformers [12, 58] and their\\nrecent application to image retrieval [13], attention is ex-\\npected to play a more and more signiﬁcant role in vi-\\nsion. According to our classiﬁcation, transformers perform\\nglobal spatial attention alone. It is of great interest to in-\\nvestigate the role of the other forms of attention, where our\\n8\\napproach may yield a basic building block of such archi-\\ntectures. One may even envision an extension to language\\nmodels, where transformers originate from [50].\\nReferences\\n[1] Relja Arandjelovi´c, Petr Gronat, Akihiko Torii, Tomas Pa-\\njdla, and Josef Sivic.\\nNetVLAD: CNN architecture for\\nweakly supervised place recognition.

Many data driven applications involve processing\\nmassive timeseries data, including IoT [11], medical AI [14], stock\\nmarket [27], and so on. As such, there is a great need for timeseries\\nanalytics, such as forecasting [8], classification [20], clustering [31],\\nsimilarity search [39], and anomaly detection [50], with applications\\nranging from automatically diagnosing diseases [5], recognizing\\nhuman activities [29], to stopping financial fraud [59].\\nEffective feature extraction [40] lies at the core of almost all\\nthese timeseries analytics tasks. Recently researchers [61] have\\nstarted leveraging the self-supervised pre-training methodology of\\nTransformers [4, 16, 52], which have proven remarkably successful\\nin natural language processing (NLP), to automatically learn high\\nquality feature embeddings from timeseries. In NLP, self-supervised\\npre-training exploits the sequential patterns (correlations) among\\nthe words in sentences to produce contextualized feature embed-\\ndings. Timeseries bear similarity to natural language, because in\\ntimeseries data the sequential order among the values (stock price,\\nvolume, etc.) over time matters. That is, each value is highly cor-\\nrelated with other values observed before or after it. Therefore,\\n∗Corresponding Author\\npre-training a Transformer model which takes the correlations\\namong different observations into account is a natural idea to learn\\nfeature embeddings from timeseries. Indeed, the experiments in [61]\\nconfirm that Transformer-based methods outperform traditional\\ntimeseries analytics techniques.\\nHowever, existing work [61] that directly applies Transformers\\nto learn features from timeseries data have been shown not to be\\nscalable to long timeseries [30]. The idea of self-attention [52] is\\ncentral to pre-training methods in NLP: It computes pairwise cor-\\nrelations among different semantic units in a sequence (in NLP, a\\nsentence); as such, it has quadratic time and space complexity in\\nthe length of the input sequence. Such an approach places limits on\\nthe model’s scalability, especially when handling large sequences,\\nwhich are common in real-world timeseries applications such as\\nIoT, medical AI, and finance [6, 34, 62]. Predictions about timeseries\\nmay need to look at months or years of historical data to make ac-\\ncurate predictions, spanning hundreds of thousands of samples. As\\nan example, in collaboration with a research hospital we have been\\ndeveloping a seizure classifier that automatically detects seizures\\nbased on EEG signals (timeseries) collected during the clinical ob-\\nservation of patients. As seizures last only a few seconds, we chunk\\nlong EEG data into many 2 second segments and detect seizures at\\na segment level. However, the classification of a particular segment\\ndepends on up to 12 hours of prior signal to determine if one 2\\nsecond segment indicates seizure or not, because seizure diagnosis\\nneeds to consider long-term trends in the EEG data [6]. The number\\nof segments in 12 hours is more than 21k. This is far larger than\\nthe number of semantic units the typical NLP tasks expect. For\\nexample, BERT [16] limits the number of units to 512 and even\\nmassive models like GPT-3 [4] limit the number of units to 2048.\\nAlthough in NLP some lower-complexity methods have been\\nproposed to approximately compute self-attention [10, 26, 54], their\\nperformance degrades dramatically when used on timeseries, due\\nto the gap between natural language and timeseries, as we will\\nshow in our experiments.\\nProposed Approach. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we\\ndevelop RITA, a Transformer-based timeseries analytics tool, which\\nuses a novel attention mechanism, called group attention, to scale\\nto long timeseries.\\nLeveraging the periodicity of timeseries, RITA chunks the input\\ntimeseries into segments and dynamically clusters the segments\\ninto a small number (denoted as 𝑁) of groups. Segments in the\\nsame group possess similar feature embeddings during the current\\ntraining iteration, thus enabling them to approximately share the\\n1\\narXiv:2306.01926v1  [cs.LG]  2 Jun 2023\\ncomputation of attention. As the timeseries increases in length,\\nmore sharing opportunities become available. RITA then computes\\nthe self-attention at a group level and produces a compressed group\\nattention matrix. In this way, group attention eliminates both com-\\nputation and memory bottlenecks in Transformer-style models and\\nthus more scalable to long timeseries.\\nHowever, making this idea effective and efficient in Transformer\\narchitectures is challenging for several reasons:\\n• Efficiently Producing High Quality Feature Embeddings.\\nAlthough RITA computes the attention matrix at a group level, to\\npreserve the quality of the feature embeddings, it still has to pro-\\nduce different embeddings for different segments. This is because\\neven if some segments share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding. However,\\nusing the group attention matrix, the existing self-attention mech-\\nanism will only produce a single feature vector for each group. A\\nnaive solution would be to restore the original attention matrix\\nfrom the group attention matrix. However, in this case we again\\nget an attention matrix with quadratic space complexity. Because\\nGPUs have limited memory, GPU memory will remain a bottleneck\\nin group attention.\\n• The Number of Groups N. In RITA, the number of groups\\n𝑁is a crucial factor that balances the speed up and the quality of\\nattention approximation. A small 𝑁will lead to a large speedup,\\nbut the approximation errors can also be significant. On the other\\nhand, although a large 𝑁tends to produce high-quality approxima-\\ntions, it inevitably slows down the training process. Therefore, an\\nappropriate 𝑁is essential to the performance of group attention.\\nHowever, 𝑁depends on the distributional properties of the dataset.\\nFurthermore, like the classical transformer models, RITA stacks\\nmultiple attention layers to produce better embeddings. Ideally,\\ndifferent layers should also use different values of 𝑁. In addition,\\nduring the model training phrase, group attention should use dif-\\nferent values of 𝑁at different iterations to adapt to the varying\\nfeature embeddings. This makes manually setting appropriate 𝑁\\nalmost impossible.\\n• Batch Size. Moreover, as we want to dynamically adjust 𝑁\\nduring training, a fixed batch size is sub-optimal: as 𝑁decreases,\\nthe memory usage of a single sample decreases. This allows a larger\\nbatch size which is beneficial, because: (1) it makes full use of GPU\\nmemory; (2) high-parallelism across the samples in a big batch\\nbrings better performance. Our experimental study shows that\\ndoubling the batch size reduces the training time by 30%, while still\\npreserving the quality of the model. Thus, RITA should dynamically\\nadjust batch size as 𝑁changes.\\nTo address the above problems, we first propose an embedding\\naggregation strategy and a customized group softmax function to\\nreplace the classical softmax function [52]. Together they ensure\\nRITA is able to directly use the compressed attention matrix to\\nproduce different feature embeddings for different segments. We\\ntheoretically show the embeddings RITA produces in this way are\\nidentical to those produced by first re-storing the original large\\nattention matrix. Thus RITA is able to produce high quality embed-\\ndings without introducing extra overhead. Further, we design a GPU\\nfriendly algorithm to group the segments in parallel, effectively\\nminimizing the grouping cost.\\nP0\\nPosition\\nEmbedding\\nW1\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nWindow \\nEmbedding\\n+\\nE0\\nRaw\\nTimeseries\\nTime-aware \\nConvolution\\nW[CLS]\\nW2\\n⊗\\n.....\\nWn\\nP1\\nP2\\n.....\\nPn\\n.....\\nE1\\nE2\\nEn\\n.....\\nO0\\nO1\\nO2\\nOn\\n.....\\nRITA Encoder\\nScale & Input\\nFigure 1: RITA Architecture\\nSecond, we design an adaptive scheduler which dynamically de-\\ncides an appropriate 𝑁for each group attention layer during the\\ntraining process. It starts with a large 𝑁and iteratively merges\\ngroups that are similar to each other. Guided by an error bound on\\nthe approximated self-attention that users can tolerate, it automati-\\ncally determines if two groups are mergeable, performing merging\\nefficiently in a GPU-friendly way.\\nMoreover, we propose a learning-based method to model the\\ncorrelation between the number of groups 𝑁and the batch size 𝐵.\\nThis model is used to predict 𝐵for a given 𝑁when training RITA.\\nSpecifically, we first sample some 𝑁values in a reasonable range.\\nFor each sampled 𝑁, we find a batch size that consumes up to a\\ncertain percentage of GPU memory in a cost-efficient way. Using a\\nsmall set of mathematical functions as a prior, RITA learns a model\\nwith only a few <N, B> pairs as ground truth labels.\\nOur experiments on public timeseries benchmarks and the MGH\\nEEG data [6] confirm that RITA outperforms state-of-the-art meth-\\nods in accuracy on various timeseries analytics tasks, while our\\ngroup attention mechanism achieves a 63X speedup with much\\nless memory required, compared to existing self-attention mecha-\\nnisms [10, 52, 54].\\nContributions. The key contributions of this work include:\\n• Our group attention mechanism leverages the periodicity of\\ntimeseries, reducing the time and space complexity of the self-\\nattention mechanism with accuracy guarantees, allowing RITA to\\nscale to long timeseries data.\\n• Guided by an approximation error bound, our adaptive sched-\\nuler dynamically adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nto the distribution properties of the evolving feature embeddings,\\nmaking group attention efficient and easily tunable.\\n• We conduct experiments on various datasets and different ana-\\nlytics tasks, demonstrating that RITA is 4 to 63 times faster than\\nthe state-of-the-art while achieving better accuracy when handling\\nlong timeseries (length ≥2000).\\n2\\n2\\nBACKGROUND\\nWe provide some background on the canonical self-attention mod-\\nule in the Transformer[52]. A self-attention module takes 𝑛hidden\\nembedding vectors 𝐻∈R𝑛∗𝑑ℎas input, then projects them to\\nqueries (𝑄), keys (𝐾) and values (𝑉) and performs Scaled-dot Prod-\\nuct Attention, which given input hidden state 𝐻, is computed by:\\n𝑄= 𝐻𝑊𝑄, 𝐾= 𝐻𝑊𝐾,𝑉= 𝐻𝑊𝑉\\n𝑂= 𝐴𝑉= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥( 𝑄𝐾𝑇\\n√︁\\n𝑑𝑘\\n)𝑉\\n(1)\\nWhere 𝑊𝑄∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝐾∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑉∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑣are projection\\nmatrices for generating 𝑄, 𝐾,𝑉. 𝑄∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘is also regarded as the\\npacking of 𝑛query vectors {𝑞1, ...,𝑞𝑛} with dimension 𝑑𝑘into a\\nmatrix. 𝐾∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘,𝑉∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑣are regarded as the packing of key\\nvectors {𝑘1, ...,𝑘𝑛} and value vectors {𝑣1, ..., 𝑣𝑛} in the same way.\\nGiven a matrix 𝑀∈R𝐿∗𝑛, the softmax function normalizes 𝑀\\nto ensure the sum of each row equals to 1, as shown below.\\n𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑀𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑛−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑘)\\n(2)\\nNote the attention matrix A is an 𝑛×𝑛matrix, where 𝑛represents\\nthe number of elements in the input sequence (e.g. words in NLP).\\n3\\nRITA OVERVIEW\\nGiven a collection of unlabeled timeseries, RITA first pre-trains\\na Transformer-style model to produce high quality feature em-\\nbeddings for timeseries data. This pre-trained model is then used\\nto support various downstream tasks, similar to BERT [16]. Next,\\nwe overview the model architecture of RITA. We show how RITA\\nsupports various downstream tasks in Appendix A.7.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, RITA is consist of two components: (1) Time-\\naware Convolution Layer (2) RITA Encoder.\\nTime-aware Convolution Layer fills the gap between timeseries\\nand natural language. Despite their high-level similarity, there is a\\nbig gap between timeseries and natural language. First, in natural\\nlanguage each word, as a discrete semantic unit, has an indepen-\\ndent meaning, while each element in a timeseries is a continuous,\\nnumerical value and does not necessarily constitute an independent\\nevent. Furthermore, the input sequences are single-channeled in\\nNLP, but often multi-channeled in timeseries (i.e., sensor data often\\nconsists of several related channels).\\nRITA leverages the classical convolution [28] strategy to solve\\nthis problem. Convolution is widely used to capture the local struc-\\ntures of an image. We use convolution to chunk one input timeseries\\ninto a sequence of windows and learn the local structure of each\\nwindow, similar to the discrete semantic units in natural language.\\nIt also discovers the correlations across different channels, thus\\nnaturally solving the multi-channel problem.\\nMore specifically, treating a multi-variate timeseries of length 𝑛\\nand with𝑚variables as an n × m matrix𝑇, RITA uses𝑑convolution\\nkernels to chunk𝑇into n windows and produce one d-dimensional\\nembedding per window using the convolution operation [28]. Each\\nconvolution kernel corresponds to a w × m matrix, where 𝑤defines\\nthe number of timestamps that each convolution kernel covers,\\nidentical to the window size in sliding window.\\nRITA Encoder functions as Transformer Encoder as described in\\nthe original Transformer work[52]. It takes the embeddings of 𝑛\\nsemantic units 𝑋1,𝑋2, ...,𝑋𝑛(𝑋𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as input (e.g. embeddings of\\n𝑛windows for a timeseries), then models the correlations between\\nthe semantic units and outputs 𝑌1, ...,𝑌𝑛(𝑌𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as the context-\\naware embedding of each unit.\\nWhat makes RITA Encoder different from Transformer Encoder\\nis that: at the core of Transformer Encoder lies self-attention mech-\\nanism which incurs a 𝑂(𝑛2) time complexity and memory usage.\\nThis quadratic cost becomes prohibitive for long timeseries and\\nlimits the scalablity of Transformer-based models. To make the\\nattention computation efficient yet high-quality, we replace the\\ncanonical self-attention with our proposed group attention.\\nSelf-supervised Pretraining. Inspired by the “cloze text” pre-\\ntraining task in NLP, we designed a mask-and-predict task as the\\npretraining task for our model. The timeseries is randomly masked\\nand the model should recover the masked values based on corre-\\nsponding contextual information.\\nTo be specific, we generate masks on time-stamps, with a mask\\nrate 𝑝. The timeseries is scaled to be non-negative and the values\\nacross all the channels on the masked timestamps are set to be -1,\\nan impossible value on normal timestamps. Then the masked time-\\nseries is fed into RITA and the output representation is translated\\nto the recovered timeseries by a Transpose Convolution layer.\\n4\\nGROUP ATTENTION MECHANISM\\nGroup attention, a novel and efficient approximate attention mecha-\\nnism, addresses the performance bottleneck of self-attention in the\\nvanilla Transformer. In this section, we first introduce the frame-\\nwork of group attention and then theoretically establish the bound\\nof its approximation error.\\n4.1\\nThe Idea of Group Attention\\nAs periodicity is a natural property of timeseries [56], similar\\nwindows frequently occur. Similar windows result in similar\\nqueries/keys for attention computation, bringing opportunities for\\nsaving computation.\\nAs discussed in Sec. 2, 𝐴𝑖𝑗, the attention score of window 𝑖onto\\nwindow 𝑗, is determined by the inner product between the query\\nvector of window 𝑖and the key vector of window 𝑗, that is, 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗.\\nGiven another window 𝑥, if window 𝑥has the similar key vector\\nto window 𝑗, that is, 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥, then 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗≈𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑥. In other words,\\n𝐴𝑖𝑗≈𝐴𝑖𝑥when 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥.\\nThis observation inspires our group attention mechanism. That\\nis, we group the windows by their similarity in keys. Assuming\\nall windows in the same group have the same attention score onto\\nanother window 𝑘, we then only compute the attention once by\\nusing one single key to represent this group, for example the centroid\\nof the group of keys. This thus saves significant computation cost.\\nBetter yet, after grouping 𝑛windows into 𝑁groups, group atten-\\ntion compresses the attention matrix from an𝑛×𝑛matrix to an𝑛×𝑁\\nmatrix. Because 𝑁(number of groups) tends to be much smaller\\nthan 𝑛(number of windows) due to the periodicity of timeseries,\\ngroup attention consumes much less memory than the original\\nself-attention mechanism, successfully eliminating the memory\\nbottleneck. Note that it also doesn’t hurt quality all that much, as\\nconfirmed in our experiments (Sec. 6.2).\\n3\\nGrouping\\nAverage\\nK\\nQ\\nMatMul\\nAttention Matrix\\nWeighted\\nSoftMax\\nV\\nSum\\nAggregate\\nTranspose\\nMatMul\\nOutput\\nQ \\nK \\nV\\nFigure 2: Group Attention\\n4.2\\nComputing the Output Feature Embedding\\nWe now discuss how to efficiently compute the output feature\\nembeddings using the small compressed group attention matrix.\\n4.2.1\\nProblem: Producing Embeddings w/ Group Attention Matrix\\nAs described in the Background, once we have acquired the at-\\ntention matrix 𝐴, canonical self-attention computes the output\\nembedding 𝑂as O = AV. Because 𝐴is an 𝑛× 𝑛matrix and 𝑉is an\\n𝑛×𝑑𝑣matrix, the matrix product operation still produces an 𝑛×𝑑𝑣\\nmatrix 𝑂. That is, it produces a 𝑑𝑣dimensional feature vector for\\neach window. However, our group attention will produce an 𝑛× 𝑁\\nattention matrix e\\n𝐴, where 𝑁corresponds to the number of groups.\\nIn this case the matrix product will produce a 𝑁×𝑑𝑣matrix e\\n𝑂. That\\nis, it produces a feature vector for each group. However, our goal\\nis to produce different embeddings for different windows, because\\neven if some windows share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding.\\nA Naive Solution. A naive solution would be to restore the full\\nattention matrix 𝐴from the group attention matrix e\\n𝐴. For example,\\ngiven one group composed of 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗, we map its group\\nattention vector in e\\n𝐴into two rows that correspond to 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗in 𝐴. However, in this case we again get a 𝑛× 𝑛attention\\nmatrix; and GPU memory remains a bottleneck in group attention.\\n4.2.2\\nSolution: Embedding Aggregation and Group SoftMax\\nUsing an embedding aggregation operation and a group softmax\\nfunction, RITA produces 𝑛embeddings without restoring the full\\nattention matrix. Fig. 2 shows the workflow of group attention.\\nEmbedding Aggregation. The idea is inspired by the observation\\non the matrix product operation O = AV conducted on the fully\\nrestored attention matrix 𝐴.\\nGiven an element𝑂𝑖,𝑗of𝑂corresponding to the 𝑗𝑡ℎdimension of\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖’s feature vector,𝑂𝑖,𝑗= 𝑎𝑖·𝑣𝑗, where vector ai ∈Rn denotes the\\n𝑖𝑡ℎrow of the attention matrix 𝐴and vector vj ∈Rn denotes the 𝑗𝑡ℎ\\ndimension of all the 𝑛feature vectors. Given ai =< a1\\ni , a2\\ni , · · · , an\\ni >\\nand vj =< v1\\nj , v2\\nj , · · · , vn\\nj >, 𝑂𝑖,𝑗= Ín\\nk=1 ak\\ni vk\\nj .\\nAs an example, assume 𝑤𝑖𝑛1 and 𝑤𝑖𝑛2 belong to the same group\\n𝐺1. Then 𝑎1\\n𝑖= 𝑎2\\n𝑖= e𝑎1\\n𝑖, where e𝑎1\\n𝑖∈e\\n𝐴corresponds to the attention\\nof group 𝐺1 onto 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖. Therefore, 𝑎1\\n𝑖𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑎2\\n𝑖𝑣2\\n𝑗= e𝑎1\\n𝑖(𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑣2\\n𝑗).\\nAs an immediate generalization of the above analysis, if we ag-\\ngregate up the windows that belong to the same group and convert\\nthe n-dimensional feature vector 𝑣𝑗into a 𝑁-dimensional group fea-\\nture vectore𝑣𝑗beforehand, we could directly use the group attention\\nvector e𝑎𝑖and the group feature vector e𝑣𝑗to compute 𝑂𝑖,𝑗.\\nUsing embedding aggregation, RITA is able to produce the fea-\\nture embedding e\\n𝑂that is identical to the embedding 𝑂produced\\nby using the full attention matrix 𝐴and the embedding matrix 𝑉.\\nGroup Softmax Function. In canonical self-attention the atten-\\ntion matrix 𝐴is computed as 𝐴= SoftMax( QKT\\n√\\ndk ). To compute 𝐴,\\nwe have to first compute 𝑄𝐾𝑇(denoted as 𝑃) which is an 𝑛× 𝑛\\nmatrix. Then normalizing the 𝑃matrix with softmax produces the\\nattention matrix 𝐴.\\nGroup attention follows the same procedure. But after grouping\\nkeys into e𝐾, 𝑄e𝐾𝑇produces an 𝑛× 𝑁matrix e𝑃. Due to the non-\\nlinearity of the softmax function, applying softmax directly on e𝑃\\nwill result in a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴from which we are not able\\nto recover a full attention matrix that is identical to first restoring\\ne𝑃to 𝑃and then applying softmax on 𝑃. The 𝐴matrix produced\\nby the latter is desirable, as we want to approximate the original\\nattention matrix as accurately as possible. However, restoring the\\nsmall 𝑛× 𝑁e𝑃matrix is not memory efficient, as it will end up with\\na full 𝑛× 𝑛matrix 𝑃.\\nTo solve the above problems, we introduce a new group softmax\\nfunction to replace the original softmax function (Eq. 2).\\n𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(g\\n𝑃𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑘)\\n(3)\\nIn Eq. 3, 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘represents the number of windows that Group\\n𝐺𝑘contains. Compared to the original softmax, our group softmax\\nconsiders each group 𝐺𝑘as 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘elements and counts it 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘\\ntimes when summing up the exponential of each group’s 𝑃𝑖,𝑘. In\\nthis way, the group softmax function operating on the small e𝑃\\nmatrix will produce exactly the same result to the softmax function\\noperating on the full 𝑃matrix.\\nTheoretical Guarantee. In Appendix A.4, we prove that the group\\nsoftmax function and the embedding aggregation operation produce\\nthe same output feature embedding with the naive method that has\\nto first restore the big full attention matrix.\\nWe show an efficient implementation of the embedding aggrega-\\ntion operation and group softmax function in Appendix A.2, Alg. 1.\\nTime Complexity. The time complexity of Alg. 1 is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁𝑑) and\\nthe space complexity is𝑂(𝑛𝑁), while the time and space complexity\\nof the original self-attention mechanism are 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑) and 𝑂(𝑛2).\\n4.3\\nError Bound\\nGroup attention produces a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴which approxi-\\nmates the attention matrix𝐴produced by the classical self-attention\\nwith a bounded error, as shown in Lemma 1.\\nLemma 1. Let 𝑅be the radius of the ball where all key vectors\\nlive; e𝑘𝑖be the representative of the group that contains key 𝑘𝑖. Let 𝐴\\ndenote the full attention matrix restored from e\\n𝐴. Suppose the distance\\nbetween e𝑘𝑖and 𝑘𝑖(||ek𝑖−k𝑖||) satisfies: ||ek𝑖−k𝑖|| ≤d.\\nThen ∀𝜖> 1, if d ≤ln(𝜖)\\n2R , 1\\n𝜖≤Ai,j\\nAi,j ≤𝜖\\nLemma 1 shows that the error bound 𝜖of the group attention is\\ndetermined by the distance 𝑑. As discussed in Sec. 5.1, it inspires\\nus to design a strategy to dynamically determine the number of\\ngroups 𝑁– the most critical parameter of group attention. Please\\nrefer to Appendix A.5 for the proof.\\n4\\n4.4\\nGPU Friendly Grouping Method\\nIn this section, we discuss the implementation of a grouping method.\\nTo make group attention efficient and effective, the grouping\\nmethod has to satisfy the following requirements:\\n(1) Tight distance bound: to ensure the approximation quality,\\nthe distance between each key and its group representative should\\nbe minimized according to Lemma 1.\\n(2) Lightweight: to ensure the performance gain, the grouping\\nmethod must be lightweight, at worst not exceeding the complexity\\nof group attention itself (𝑂(𝑁𝑛)).\\n(3) GPU friendly: to take advantage of GPUs, we prefer a group-\\ning method that mainly consists of matrix operations, which can\\nbe efficiently executed on a GPU.\\nTo satisfy the above requirements, after thorough investigation\\non various clustering algorithms, we design a GPU friendly K-\\nmeans [35] as the grouping method.\\nFirst, K-means minimizes the overall distance between any object\\nand its cluster center, hence naturally satisfying Requirement 1.\\nSecond, given 𝑁centers, in each iteration the time and space\\ncomplexity of K-means is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁). Usually, the iteration goes until\\nconvergence. However, we observe that rather than seeking a per-\\nfect K-means clustering, training a few iterations is sufficient to\\nget a good grouping for group attention, because typically the later\\niterations only slightly update the clustering and group attention\\nis robust to such imperfection.\\nThird, we design a GPU-friendly implementation of K-means.\\nThe performance bottleneck of K-means comes from the dis-\\ntance computation between each vector and its center, that is,\\n|vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n(vi −cj)2, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. The performance bot-\\ntleneck is 𝑣𝑖−𝑐𝑗. We instead use a different formulation: |𝑣𝑖−\\n𝑐𝑗| = |vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n|vi|2 + |cj|2 −2vi · cj, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. This is\\nbecause in this formulation, the performance bottleneck is 𝑣𝑖· 𝑐𝑗,\\nwhich could be implemented as a matrix product operation. Al-\\nthough the complexity of the two formulations is the same, in GPUs\\nmatrix product is much more efficient than pairwise difference.\\n5\\nADAPTIVE SCHEDULER\\nNext, we present the adaptive scheduler of RITA which addresses\\nthe challenges of determining an appropriate number of groups\\n𝑁and accordingly the batch size 𝐵, as described in Introduction.\\nUsing a dynamic scheduling method we propose, the scheduler\\nautomatically determines and adjusts 𝑁and 𝐵based on the distri-\\nbutional properties of the feature embeddings produced over the\\niterative training process, while guaranteed to produce high quality\\nattention approximation that meets the requirement of users.\\nIn Sec. 5.1 we show how RITA automatically determines 𝑁. Then\\nwe introduce in Sec. 5.2 the learning-based method which given an\\n𝑁, immediately predicts a good batch size.\\n5.1\\nDynamically Determining the Number of\\nGroups N\\nWithout loss of generality, we use one group attention module as\\nan example to show how RITA automatically gets an appropriate 𝑁.\\nThe adaptive scheduler of RITA starts with a large 𝑁and decreases\\nit dynamically. This is because in the training process of RITA, the\\nfeature embeddings produced epoch by epoch tend to get stabler\\nand stabler and gradually converge, thus no need to increase 𝑁.\\nRITA reduces the number of groups by merging similar groups.\\nIntuitively, given two groups, we could measure their similarity\\nbased on the distance of their centers. If the distance between\\ntheir centers is smaller than a distance threshold, then the two\\ngroups could be merged. However, setting an appropriate distance\\nthreshold seems hard – as difficult as setting an appropriate 𝑁.\\nTo solve this problem, RITA leverages the error bound of group\\nattention introduced in Sec. 4.3. It only requires users to set an\\nerror bound 𝜖, and then uses Lemma 1 to translate 𝜖to a distance\\nthreshold 𝑑. RITA then uses Lemma 2 to determine if merging some\\ngiven clusters still meets the error bound threshold 𝜖.\\nLemma 2. Denote 𝑐𝑘to be the cluster center of 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘. Assume\\nthe existing grouping satisfies ∀k,\\nmax\\nx∈clusterk\\n|ck −x| ≤d , thus satis-\\nfying an error bound 𝜖by Lemma 1. If there exist 𝑚clusters, namely,\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘2, ...,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑚, satisfying that:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑐𝑘𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑘𝑖| ≤𝑑,𝑖, 𝑗∈[1,𝑚]\\n(4)\\nmerging them into one cluster still meets the error bound 𝜖.\\nPlease refer to Appendix A.6 for the proof.\\nFinding the Mergable Clusters. We formulate the problem of\\nfinding mergeable clusters using graph theory:\\n(1) each cluster is a node in the graph;\\n(2) if 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑, and\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\nthere is an undirected edge between 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑖and 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗;\\nIn this scenario, finding the maximum number of mergeable\\nclusters is equivalent to finding the minimal clique cover in the\\ncorresponding graph, which is an NP-hard problem [24]. Such\\nheavy computation overhead is not acceptable for RITA. We thus\\noffer a simplified solution:\\n(1) Halve the clusters into two sets 𝑆1,𝑆2;\\n(2) If 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1 and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗∈𝑆2 satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\n2\\n(5)\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗is marked.\\n(3) Decrease the number of clusters by counting the masks in 𝑆2.\\nIn this solution, clusters in 𝑆1 can be regarded as transfer nodes.\\nIf (5) holds for (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1 ∈𝑆2) and (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈\\n𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗2 ∈𝑆2), respectively, we have,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗2 | ≤𝑑\\n(6)\\nThus (4) holds when merging several clusters in 𝑆2 with one\\ncluster in 𝑆1. As a result, we can greedily merge clusters in 𝑆2, as\\nillustrated in step(3).\\nAssume the number of clusters decreases by 𝐷after merging,\\nwe apply a momentum update [42] on the number of clusters 𝑁, as\\nis commonly used in machine learning to smooth the changing of\\n𝑁and avoid sample selection bias. To be specific: 𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑤= 𝛼(𝑁−\\n𝐷) + (1 −𝛼)𝑁, where 𝛼is a hyper-parameter for momentum.\\n5\\n5.2\\nDynamically Determining the Batch Size\\nBecause of the dynamic grouping operation, the computational\\ngraph in deep learning training [1] varies from sample to sample. As\\na result, it is impossible to precisely compute a batch’s GPU memory\\nusage without indeed feeding it into the model. To overcome this\\nproblem, RITA learns a batch size prediction function offline; then\\nat the RITA training time, given a number of groups 𝑁, RITA uses\\nthis function to predict a proper batch size.\\nWhen the model architecture and hardware are fixed, the batch\\nsize depends on the length of the timeseries 𝐿and the average\\ngroup number among all attention module 𝑁. So RITA samples\\nseveral (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs and estimate a proper batch size for each pair.\\nMore specifically, given a user-defined timeseries maximal length\\n𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, we randomly sample integral points (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) from plane\\n{1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}. Then we use a binary search based\\nalgorithm to find the maximal batch size 𝐵𝑖that consumes less than\\n90% available GPU memory, aiming to avoid wasting GPU memory\\nand the risks of out of memory (OOM).\\nTreating these pairs as ground truth labels, we use function\\nfitting [18] to learn the batch size predicting function B = f (L, N),\\nwhere B is a function of two variables 𝐿and 𝑁.\\nLearning the Prediction Function. We apply curve fit from\\nSciPy [53] as the function fitting tool to fit the two-variable function\\n𝐵𝑖= 𝑓(𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) on plane {1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}.\\nWe observe that applying one function to the whole plane incurs\\na huge estimation error. So we develop a dynamic-programming\\n(DP) method to divide the plane into several sub-planes and apply\\na distinct function to each sub-plane respectively. It is optimal in\\nminimizing the total estimation error on all sub-planes\\nWith the learned prediction function 𝑓, we can estimate a proper\\nbatch size for any (𝐿, 𝑁) during training, even if it is not seen in\\nthe sampled (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs.\\nThe Algorithms and Optimality Proof. Please refer to Appen-\\ndix A.3 for the pseudo code of the binary search-based algorithm\\nand the description of the DP method for plane-division and the\\nproof for its optimality.\\n6\\nEVALUATION\\nOur experimental study focuses on the following questions:\\n1. Effectiveness and efficiency of RITA: How does RITA com-\\npare with other Transformer-based methods and traditional time-\\nseries representation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency?\\n2. Ablation Study: How do the key techniques of RITA work?\\n6.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nDatasets. We evaluate RITA on classification and imputation tasks\\nusing 5 multi-variate and 3 uni-variate timeseries datasets.\\n• WISDM [55] is a popular multivariate timeseries dataset gen-\\nerated from the accelerometer in the mobile phone. The subjects\\nperformed 18 daily activities (e.g. walking, jogging). The dataset\\nwas collected from 51 subjects and the sampling rate is 20 Hz.\\n• HHAR dataset [46] contains sensing data of accelerometer col-\\nlected from 9 users performing 5 activities with 12 different smart-\\nphones (varying in sampling rate). This increases the complexity\\nof the task and thus can test the model’s robustness.\\n• RWHAR RealWorld HAR dataset [48] covers 15 subjects per-\\nforming 8 locomotion-style activities. Each subject wears the sen-\\nsors for approximately ten minutes. The sampling rate is 50 Hz.\\n• ECG dataset [34] consists of 10,000 EEG recordings for arrhyth-\\nmia classification. Each recording has an uncertain length ranging\\nfrom 6 to 60 seconds sampled at 500 Hz. The ECG recordings corre-\\nspond to 9 types of heart problems such as atrial fibrillation (AF)\\nand premature atrial contraction (PAC), etc.\\n• MGH [6] is a EEG dataset collected by Mass. General Hospital.\\nEach timeseries corresponds to the EEG data observed from one\\npatient during their stay in ICU for a couple of days. The EEG\\nmonitoring produced data with 20 channels. The sampling rate is\\n200 HZ. So it produces very long timeseries.\\n• WISDM*/HHAR*/RWHAR* are three uni-variate datasets de-\\nrived by picking one channel from WISDM/HHAR/RWHAR.\\nTraining/Validation Data Generation. We apply a sliding win-\\ndow on the raw timeseries to get training/validation samples. The\\nsize of the sliding window is set as 200 on small datasets (WISDM,\\nHHAR, RWHAR), 2000 on medium size dataset (ECG), and 10,000\\non the large dataset (MGH). Table 1 shows the statics of the gen-\\nerated datasets. They are randomly split into training/validation\\nset in a proportion of 0.9/0.1. In “pretraining + few-label finetun-\\ning” scenario, we use 100 labeled data per class for finetuning. We\\nguarantee that training set does not overlap with the validation set.\\nDataset\\nTrain.

We compare RITA against the SOTA Trans-\\nformer based timeseries representation learning method TST [61].\\nTo evaluate our group attention (referred to as Group Attn.), we\\ndevelop three baselines by replacing the group attention compo-\\nnent in RITA with the classic vanilla Self-Attention [52](referred\\nto as Vanilla) and two SOTA methods that reduce the complexity\\nof self-attention by approximation in NLP, namely, Performer [10]\\n(referred to as Performer) and Linformer [54] (referred to as Lin-\\nformer). Similar to our proposed Group Attn., Vanilla, Performer,\\nLinformer all use RITA’s time-aware convolution operation (Sec. 3)\\nto turn timeseries segments into input feature vectors.\\nWe also compare Group Attn. against GRAIL [40], which is\\nthe SOTA of the non-deep learning methods for timeseries repre-\\nsentation learning. GRAIL supports classification tasks by feeding\\nthe learned representations into a Support-Vector Machine [12]\\nor K-Nearest Neighbor [17] classifier. Note GRAIL only targets\\nuni-variate timeseries and cannot support imputation tasks.\\nMethodology. We mainly focus on two downstream tasks:\\n(1) Classification. First, we train Group Attn. and the base-\\nlines with full labels from scratch to test the effectiveness of RITA\\nframework and the approximation quality of our group attention.\\nSecond, to measure the effectiveness of self-supervised pretrain-\\ning, we evaluate the accuracy of training on few labeled timeseries\\nwith/without pretraining on large scales of unlabeled timeseries. To\\nbe specific, we split the training set into a pretraining set and a fine-\\ntuning set, with very few data in the latter (100 labeled samples per\\n6\\n(a) Effectiveness \\n(b) Efficiency\\nTraining Time/sec\\nFigure 3: Full-label classification results (multi-variate data).\\nclass in our experiment). We train the model on the cloze pretrain-\\ning task with a mask rate 𝑝= 0.2. Then we train two classification\\nmodels using the finetuning set, either based on the pretrained\\nversion or from scratch. We repeat the experiment 5 times with\\nrandom data splits and report the median accuracy.\\n(2) Imputation. We run the imputation task on the datasets used\\nin classification as well as the large unlabeled MGH dataset, and\\nmeasure the mean square error and absolute imputation error. To\\nget timeseries with missing values, we randomly mask the values\\nwith an expected mask rate of 𝑝= 0.2. The masked values are\\nreplaced with a special value.\\nFinally, to evaluate Group Attn.’s benefit on efficiency, the total\\ntime of forward computation, backward propagation, and grouping\\nare measured for all methods in all the experiments.\\nTo save space, we only report the average training time per epoch\\nhere and refer readers to Appendix A.8 for the inference time.\\nWe first compare against the Transformer-based methods on\\nmulti-variate datasets (sec. 6.2, 6.3), then compare against the non-\\ndeep learning method GRAIL on uni-variate datasets (sec. 6.4).\\nConfiguration. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for the experiment\\nconfiguration and hyper-parameter settings.\\n6.2\\nEffectiveness: Transformer-Based Methods\\nWe first evaluate the quality of the models trained with full labels\\nfrom scratch. We then show how the pretraining of RITA increases\\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks.\\n6.2.1\\nfull-label training (Multi-variate classification)\\nResults shown in Figure 3(a) get us the following observations:\\n(1) RITA’s advantage over TST. On all four datasets for the clas-\\nsification tasks, Group Attn. and the other three baselines that use\\nRITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and Linformer) outperform\\nTST. In particular, Group Attn. outperforms TST by 49 percentage\\npoints on the ECG dataset (88.48% vs 39.93%) with long timeseries.\\nTwo deficiencies in TST may cause its poor performance on the long\\ntimeseries. Firstly, TST concatenates the output embedding vector\\nof each time stamp, then uses a linear classifier to do classification\\non the concatenated vector. When the timeseries is long, the linear\\nclassifier has so many parameters that it tends to overfit easily.\\nSecondly, TST replaces Layer Normalization in vanilla Transformer\\nwith Batch Normalization. When the timeseries is long, it can only\\naccommodate a small number of timeseries in each batch, leading\\nto bias in Batch Normalization.\\n(2) Group-attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on\\n3 out of 4 datasets for classification. Although Linformer works\\nslightly better than Group Attn. on the ECG dataset (90.37% vs\\n88.84%), its performance is the worst in all other cases compared\\nto any other RITA-based methods. Vanilla computes the attention\\nscores precisely. Thus it is expected to work well. However, Group\\nAttn. outperforms Vanilla on WISDM (87.50% vs 86.95%) and is very\\nclose to it on other 3 datasets. This suggests that group attention’s\\napproximation quality is good.\\n6.2.2\\npretraining + few label finetune (Multi-variate classification)\\nThe results shown in Table 3 get us the following observation:\\n(1) Pretraining is effective. Pretraining always leads to better\\naccuracy than training with a few labels from scratch. In particular,\\non WISDM data all the methods using RITA architecture increase\\nthe accuracy by at least 10%. This is impressive considering we do\\nnot have a very large unlabeled pre-training set to use.\\n(2) RITA’s advantage over TST. our Group Attn. and other\\nthree baselines using RITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and\\nLinformer) significantly outperform TST on all four classification\\ndatasets by 25 percentage points.\\n(3) Group Attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on 3\\nout of 4 datasets. When compared to Vanilla, Group Attn. is better\\non HHAR and ECG, and comparable on the other two, further con-\\nfirming its high quality on approximation. Further, we notice that\\nLinformer struggles in this setting: in average its accuracy is worse\\nthan Vanilla by 8.22% and Group Attn. by 8.01%. This is because the\\nlow-rank projection operation introduces extra model parameters,\\nmaking Linformer more easily overfit, while overfitting is especially\\nharmful when there are only a few labeled training samples.\\n6.2.3\\nfull-dataset training (Multi-variate imputation)\\nSimilar to classification tasks, the results of imputation tasks\\n(Table.2) show that Group Attn. consistently outperforms the base-\\nlines in training time while achieving comparable/better MSE. Again,\\non the large dataset MGH (length = 10,000), TST and Vanilla fail due\\nto out of memory (OOM) errors. Methods using RITA framework\\n(Group Attn., Performer, Linformer) all achieve very low MSE (are\\nhighly accurate). Among them Linformer is the worst.\\n6.3\\nEfficiency: Transformer-based Methods\\nWe measure the efficiency by the average training time per epoch\\nincluding the cost of the forward computation + backward propaga-\\ntion and the grouping overhead. We first show the results on all the\\n5 datasets in Sec. 6.3.1. We then vary the length of the timeseries\\non the MGH dataset to show group attention’s scalability on long\\ntimeseries in Sec. 6.3.2.\\n6.3.1\\nTraining Time: All Multi-variate Datasets\\nThe results in Fig. 3(b) and Table 2 lead to the below observations:\\n(1) Vanilla Self-Attention is not scalable. In average, it takes\\n2-3 minutes to train one epoch when the length of the timeseries is\\nonly 200 (WISDM, HHAR, RWHAR), takes over 15 minutes when\\nthe length increases to 2,000 (ECG), and fails on the long MGH data\\nwhen the length reaches 10,000 due to out of GPU memory.\\n(2) Group Attn.’s advantage over all other attention mecha-\\nnisms. As we have shown in Sec. 6.2, Group Attn. is more accurate\\n7\\nDataset\\nLength\\nTST [61]\\nVanilla\\nPerformer\\nLinformer\\nGroup Attn.\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nWISDM\\n200\\n13.30\\n150.3\\n3.240\\n178.1\\n3.449\\n162.6\\n3.852\\n141.9\\n3.277\\n136.7\\nHHAR\\n200\\n1.085\\n78.2\\n0.2968\\n97.4\\n0.2980\\n82.6\\n0.3198\\n81.1\\n0.2974\\n73.3\\nRWHAR\\n200\\n0.0882\\n83.9\\n0.0478\\n108.1\\n0.0489\\n89.1\\n0.0572\\n98.4\\n0.0478\\n81.3\\nECG\\n2000\\n0.0905\\n696.3\\n0.0037\\n857.9\\n0.0033\\n270.2\\n0.0035\\n291.38\\n0.0038\\n164.36\\nMGH\\n10000\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.00014\\n356.2\\n0.00088\\n404.9\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nTable 2: Imputation results (multi-variate data).

We use the three uni-variate datasets,\\nbecause GRAIL only targets uni-variate timeseries.\\nResults in Fig. 5 show that on all 3 datasets RITA significantly\\noutperforms GRAIL in accuracy by 45, 16, and 21 percentage points\\nbecause of the expressive power of Transformer. Moreover, thanks\\nto the GPU-friendly design of RITA, it is at least 2× faster than\\nGRAIL in training time.\\n6.5\\nAblation Study\\n6.5.1\\nAdaptive Scheduler\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RITA’s adaptive scheduler (Sec. 5),\\nwe compare it against a baseline using a fixed group number 𝑁. We\\nvary 𝑁and the error bound threshold 𝜖used by RITA.\\nFrom the results in Table 4 we get the following observations:\\n(1) Adaptive Scheduler is better than fixed 𝑁. Training with\\nAdaptive Scheduler already achieves better or comparable perfor-\\nmance compared to the best performing 𝑁. More specifically, on\\nthe MGH dataset, dynamic scheduler always achieves better accu-\\nracy and is much faster compared to fixed 𝑁. On the ECG dataset,\\nalthough fixed 𝑁is slightly better than adaptive scheduler in accu-\\nracy when setting the N as 512, it runs much slower than adaptive\\nscheduler. Of course, finding the best 𝑁that balances the accuracy\\nand running time requires careful tuning.\\n(2) Adaptive Scheduler is tuning free. It is robust on both\\naccuracy and running time when 𝜖varies, while the results of\\nfixed 𝑁vary significantly when the value of 𝑁changes. Therefore,\\nAdaptive Scheduler frees the users from tuning the 𝜖threshold,\\nwhile it is hard to find an appropriate 𝑁for a given dataset.\\n8\\nDataset\\nTask\\nScheduler\\nParameter\\nMetric\\nTime\\nECG\\nClass.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n88.34%\\n292.5\\n2\\n88.48%\\n236.8\\n3\\n87.83%\\n216.8\\nFixed\\n64\\n87.50%\\n255.2\\n128\\n88.96%\\n297.2\\n256\\n88.82%\\n414.1\\n512\\n90.03%\\n662.6\\n1024\\n88.65%\\n873.7\\nMGH\\nImput.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n0.00041\\n60.7\\n2\\n0.00040\\n57.9\\n3\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nFixed\\n128\\n0.00054\\n128.6\\n256\\n0.00053\\n190.2\\n512\\n0.00049\\n240.8\\n1024\\n0.00046\\n323.3\\nTable 4: Adaptive Scheduling VS Fixed N.\\nPretrain Data size\\nFew-label Accuracy\\nN/A\\n62.56%\\n12,446\\n72.94%\\n24,892\\n72.78%\\n37,338\\n74.10%\\n49,784\\n74.22%\\n62,231\\n75.06%\\nTable 5: RITA Pretraining: increasing sizes of pretrain set.\\n6.5.2\\nThe Sizes of the Pretraining Data\\nNext, we evaluate how the number of unlabeled data influences the\\neffectiveness of pretraining. To get empirical results, we pretrain\\nRITA on WISDM dataset with 20%/40%/60%/80% of the pretraining\\ndata and finetune each pretrained model with 100 labels per class.\\nThe results in Table 5 show that: (1) The more pretraining data,\\nthe larger the improvement. The accuracy increases with the\\nsizes of the pretraining data; (2) Marginal utility diminishing.\\nThe first 20% pretraining data gives a 10.38% improvement in accu-\\nracy (72.94% vs 62.56%), while the remaining 80% pretraining data\\nonly gives an additional improvement of 2.12% (75.06% vs 72.94%).\\n7\\nRELATED WORK\\n7.1\\nTimeseries Analytics\\nThere is a great deal of prior work on timeseries analytics methods.\\nThis work can be divided into three categories: (1) non-deep learn-\\ning methods; (2) CNN/RNN-based deep learning methods; and (3)\\nTransformer-based deep learning methods.\\nTraditional Methods. These methods, such as TS-CHIEF [45],\\nHIVE-COTE [33], ROCKET [15] have achieved notable performance\\non public datasets. Despite that, traditional methods suffer from\\none or more issues: they (1) rely on expert knowledge for feature\\nextraction; (2) incur heavy computation cost and are inappropriate\\nfor GPU devices; (3) support only uni-variate timeseries; (4) perform\\nclassification solely. Some work [61] shows that the transformed-\\nbased methods outperform these traditional methods especially on\\nmulti-variate timeseries.\\nIn particular, as the SOTA of timeseries representation learn-\\ning, GRAIL [40] extracts landmarks from data and computes the\\nrepresentations with the combination of the landmarks. However,\\nGRAIL only supports uni-variate timeseries. Our experiments (Sec. 6.4)\\nshow that RITA significantly outperforms GRAIL in both effective-\\nness and efficiency on uni-variate timeseries.\\nCNN/RNN-based Deep Learning Methods. CNN-based methods,\\nsuch as InceptionTime [21] and Resnet [19], are good at classifica-\\ntion tasks, but can not handle generative tasks such as forecasting\\nbecause of the inductive bias of convolution networks. RNN-based\\nmethods, such as Brit [7] and deepAR [44], are capable for classifi-\\ncation, regression and generation. However, the recurrent structure\\nbrings a lot of problems: (1) limiting the model’s ability in captur-\\ning long-range correlation; (2) notoriously difficult to train [41]\\nbecause of gradient vanishing and exploding problem. As a result,\\nsuch methods can hardly scale to very long timeseries.\\nTransformer-based Deep Learning Methods. Given that Trans-\\nformer is the best choice for backbone in almost all sequence mod-\\neling tasks, some effort has been made to apply Transformer to\\ntimeseries analytics. Targeting forecasting of uni-variate timeseries,\\nLogTrans [30] introduced a log sparsity assumption to attention\\ncomputation. Informer [62] pushes LogTrans a step further and\\nscales forecasting to multi-variate timeseries. Autoformer [57] per-\\nforms forecasting by decomposing timeseries into two parts, i.e.\\nthe trend part and the seasonal part.\\nFor imputation tasks, CDSA [37] outperforms statistical meth-\\nods and the SOTA of RNN-based method Brit [7] on 3 public and\\n2 competition datasets. For timeseries classification, AutoTrans-\\nformer [43] performs architecture search to adapt to the tasks\\nin different domains. For timeseries anomaly detection, Anomaly\\nTransformer [58] outperforms many widely-used methods such\\nas OmniAnomaly [47], assuming the attention score maps show\\nGaussian distribution.\\nAll of these works are designed for specific tasks, rather than\\nfunctioning as a representation learning framework to serve\\ndifferent downstream tasks. To fill this gap, some researchers pro-\\nposed a Transformer-based architecture, called TST [61]. Like RITA,\\nTST supports regression, classification, and unsupervised learning\\nthrough the “cloze test” pretraining task on timeseries. However,\\nTST directly uses the classical Vanilla self-attention, thus not scal-\\nable to long timeseries as shown in our experiments (Sec. 6.3.2).\\n7.2\\nEfficient Transformers\\nThe need of improving the scalability of Transformers has led to\\nmore efficient variations of Transformers, especially for accommo-\\ndating long text data in NLP [49].\\nIntroducing fixed/random patterns to self-attention mechanism\\nis an intuitive idea. Sparse Transformer [9] and Longformer [3] only\\ncompute attention at fixed intervals. ETC [2] and BigBird [60] use\\nglobal-local attention: the attention computation is limited within\\na fixed radius, while some auxiliary tokens are added to attend/get\\nattended globally. The deficiencies of fixed attention patterns are\\nobvious: it heavily depends on users to give an optimal setting.\\nTo decrease the reliance on human labor, some works seek to\\nintroduce learnable/adaptive attention patterns instead of fixed\\npatterns. Reformer [26] proposed only computing the dominant\\nattention terms based on their observation of sparsity in atten-\\ntion matrix from language/image data. Such sparsity is intuitive\\nin language data, in which a word’s attention mainly focuses on\\nthe nearby sentences. However, attention in timeseries data shows\\nstrong seasonal patterns rather than sparse patterns, mainly as\\n9\\nresult of the periodicity of timeseries data. Therefore, such works\\ndo not work well for timeseries.\\nApart from introducing attention patterns, some works seek\\nto solve this problem with applied mathematics techniques. Lin-\\nformer [54] performs a projection to decrease the size of query,\\nkey and value matrices before attention computation, because the\\nattention matrix tends to be low-ranked. Performer [10] uses linear\\nfunctions to approximate the kernel function softmax, making at-\\ntention computation commutative. When the sequence length is far\\ngreater than the dimension of embedding vectors, Performer ben-\\nefits from changing the order of matrix multiplication. Linformer\\nand Performer do not depend on the unique properties of language\\ndata, thus potentially fitting timeseries better than other techniques,\\nwhich is why we compared against them in our experiments. How-\\never as shown in Sec. 6, our group attention significantly outper-\\nforms them in both accuracy and efficiency (training time), because\\ngroup attention fully leverages the periodicity of timeseries.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we presented RITA, an automatic, self-supervised, and\\nscalable timeseries analytics tool. RITA effectively adapts Trans-\\nformer, popular in NLP, into timeseries analytics. As the key com-\\nponent of RITA, group attention eliminates the performance bottle-\\nneck of the classical self-attention mechanisms, thus successfully\\nscaling RITA to highly complex, long timeseries data. Our experi-\\nments confirm that RITA significantly speeds up the state-of-the-art\\nby 63X with a better accuracy.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen,\\nCraig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al.\\n2016.

All models were trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100\\n16GB GPU. All the methods are optimized with AdamW [36] of\\nwhich the starting learning rate and weight decay parameter are\\nboth 1𝑒−4. In full-label training scenario, we train the models for\\n100 epochs. In “pretraining + few-label finetuning scenario”, as the\\npretrained models require fewer epochs to converge [61], we train\\nthe model for 50 epochs.

It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing.

Introduction\\nThe ubiquitous deployment of Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) results in ever-growing amounts of compute spent\\non inference (Patterson et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2023; Kad-\\ndour et al., 2023a; Xia et al., 2024; Reid et al., 2024). Fur-\\nther, serving models with low latencies remains challenging\\nbecause contemporary Transformer architectures employ\\nthe self-attention mechanism with quadratic input complex-\\nity (Touvron et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Bi et al., 2024).\\nIn this work, we delve deeper into the concept of layer\\nskipping (Fan et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022a) to reduce\\nthe computation on superfluous LLM components. Our\\nfindings demonstrate that pruning deeper attention layers\\ndoes not significantly affect performance. When applied\\nto Llama-v2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we maintain good\\nperformance on the OpenLLM (ARC (Clark et al., 2018),\\n*Equal contribution\\n1University College London,\\nUK\\n2University of Edinburgh, UK.

Layer skipping\\nConsider a Transformer model M with L layers, each\\nconsisting of an attention sub-layer followed by a multi-\\nlayer perceptron (MLP) sub-layer. We denote each layer as\\nMi = (Attentioni, MLPi) for i ∈{1, 2, . . . , L}.\\nTo compare the performance of Transformer models when\\nskipping specific sub-layers, we create two variants of the\\nmodel:\\n1. Skipping MLP Layers: We construct a model Mskip MLP\\n1\\narXiv:2407.15516v1  [cs.LG]  22 Jul 2024\\nAttention Is All You Need But You Don’t Need All Of It\\nby skipping the MLP sub-layer from the last k layers. The\\nresulting model is Mskip MLP = {(Attentioni, MLPi) | i ∈\\n{1, 2, . . . , L −k}} ∪{(Attentioni, ∅) | i ∈{L −k +\\n1, . . . , L}}.\\n2.

Skip mechanisms for skipping single layers and entire\\nTransformer blocks (ffwd and attention layers) during inference.\\n2.2. Motivation: Are Deeper Layers More Redundant?\\nIn Transformer models, the last layers have been shown to\\ncontribute less information than earlier layers, making it\\npossible to drop those layers at a minimal performance cost\\n(Fan et al., 2019; Zhang & He, 2020; Wang et al., 2022a;\\nSchuster et al., 2022; Kaddour et al., 2023b; Belrose et al.,\\n2023).\\nTo verify this, we experiment with removing either the at-\\ntention sublayers or the MLP sublayers. Figure 1 shows the\\ncosine similarities between a layer’s features and the previ-\\nous layer showing that deeper layers have a lower impact\\non the features than earlier layers. One notable exception\\nto this trend is that the last layer for both Llama-v2 7B and\\n13B has the lowest cosine similarity with the previous layer.\\nPrevious analysis of the attention mechanism has shown\\nthat they can converge to the same value due to attention\\ncollapse (Zhai et al., 2023) and token features that also con-\\nverge to the same value due to over-smoothing (Wang et al.,\\n2022b; Dovonon et al., 2024) or rank collapse (Dong et al.,\\n2023), with solutions to these issues typically improving\\nperformance (Ali et al., 2023; Choi et al., 2024).\\n3. Results\\nExperimental Setup\\nFor all experiments, we use either\\nLlama-v2-7B or Llama-v2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023a;b),\\ntwo LLMs trained on trillions of publically available tokens.\\nWe experiment with keeping 66%, 75%, 90% and 100% of\\nthe network and report the corresponding results in Table 1.\\nWe also experiment with removing attention sublayers in\\nTable 2, MLP sublayers in Table 3, and a varying number of\\nlayers similar to Table 1 but keeping the last layer in Table 4.\\n3.1.

Related Work\\nEarly Exit during inference\\nEarly exit methods have also\\nbeen proposed in other domains (Graves, 2017; Teerapit-\\ntayanon et al., 2017) before getting adapted to autoregressive\\nmodels (Elbayad et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2022; Din et al.,\\n2023; Elhoushi et al., 2024; Fan et al., 2024; Chen et al.,\\n2024). The idea works by dynamically allocating compute\\nbased on the difficulty of the input sequence. Our method\\nprunes the deepest layers and does not involve any level of\\nadaptability. This is beneficial because it does not require\\nthe entire model to be loaded in memory. Dropping layers\\nduring inference has been done on BERT-like models in\\n(Wang et al., 2022a; Sajjad et al., 2023). We apply a similar\\nanalysis to more recent LLMs and study the impact of skip-\\nping attention and/or MLP layers in more detail. Concurrent\\nwork to ours by Gromov et al. (2024) yields similar results\\nby pruning deeper layers and applying fine-tuning on the\\npruned model.\\nLayer dropping/growing during training\\nThere are var-\\nious works studying the dropping/growing layers dynami-\\ncally during training (Fan et al., 2019; Gong et al., 2019;\\nKaddour et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023). In\\ncontrast, this work focuses on dropping layers of an already\\npre-trained model in a way similar to Men et al. (2024).\\nOther Inference Speedup Methods\\nOther works to speed\\nup inference include compressing KV caches (Nawrot et al.,\\n2024; Wu & Tu, 2024; Bi et al., 2024), speculative decoding\\n(Chen et al., 2023), efficient memory management (Kwon\\net al., 2023), or subqudratic attention architectures (Fu et al.,\\n2022; Peng et al., 2023; Gu & Dao, 2023), an overview has\\nbeen provided by Kaddour et al. (2023a).\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe investigated the effect of dropping the last layers from\\nthe 7B and 13B Llama2 models. We observe that dropping\\nattention sublayers lead to much lower drops in performance\\nthan dropping the MLP sublayers, whether the last layer\\nis included or not, while also leading to better inference\\nspeedups. For example, removing 33% of attention layers\\nleads to an 18% speedup in a 13B Llama2 model at the cost\\nof a 1.8% drop in average performance. This shows that\\nmassive improvements can be made over dropping entire\\nlayers from just dropping the attention sublayer.\\nReferences\\nAli, A., Galanti, T., and Wolf, L.

Introduction\\nInstance-level image retrieval is at the core of visual rep-\\nresentation learning and is connected with many problems\\nof visual recognition and machine learning, for instance\\nmetric learning [30, 26], few-shot learning [42] and unsu-\\npervised learning [8]. Many large-scale open datasets [3,\\n37, 16, 29, 53], and competitions1 have accelerated progress\\nin instance-level image retrieval, which has been trans-\\nformed by deep learning [3].\\nMany studies on instance-level image retrieval focus\\non learning features from convolutional neural networks\\n(CNN), while others focus on re-ranking, for instance by\\ngraph-based methods [11]. The former can be distinguished\\naccording to feature types: local descriptors, reminiscent of\\nSIFT [27], where an image is mapped to a few hundred vec-\\ntors; and global descriptors, where an image is mapped to a\\n1https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2020\\nsingle vector. In fact, deep learning has brought global de-\\nscriptors with astounding performance, while allowing efﬁ-\\ncient search. Our study belongs to this type.\\nStudies on global descriptors have focused on spatial\\npooling [2, 37]. The need for compact, discriminative rep-\\nresentations that are resistant to clutter has naturally given\\nrise to spatial attention methods [24, 28]. Different kinds\\nof attention have been studied in many areas of computer\\nvision research. There is also channel attention [20, 9]; lo-\\ncal attention, applied independently to elements of the rep-\\nresentation (feature map) [54, 25]; global attention, based\\non interaction between elements [52, 9]; and combinations\\nthereof. Unfortunately, each study has been limited to one or\\ntwo kinds of attention only; attention is not always learned;\\nand applications vary.\\nIt is the objective of our work to perform a compre-\\nhensive study of all forms of attention above, apply them\\nto instance-level image retrieval and provide a detailed ac-\\ncount of their interaction and impact on performance. As\\nshown in Figure 1, we collect contextual information from\\nimages with both local and global attention, giving rise to\\ntwo parallel network streams. Importantly, each operates\\non both spatial locations and feature channels. Local at-\\ntention is about individual locations and channels; global is\\nabout interaction between locations and between channels.\\nThe extracted information is separately embedded in local\\nand global attention feature maps, which are combined in a\\nglobal-local attention feature map before pooling.\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n1. We propose a novel network that consists of both\\nglobal and local attention for image retrieval. This is\\nthe ﬁrst study that employs both mechanisms.\\n2. Each of the global and local attention mechanisms\\ncomprises both spatial and channel attention.\\n3. Focusing on global descriptors, we provide empirical\\nevidence of the interaction of all forms of attention and\\nimprove the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n1\\narXiv:2107.08000v1  [cs.CV]  16 Jul 2021\\nAl\\nc\\nc × 1 × 1\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\nc\\nAl\\ns\\n1 × h × w\\n×\\n+\\nFl\\n×\\nc × h × w\\nF\\n×\\n+\\nc × h × w\\nFgl\\nAg\\nc\\nc × c\\n×\\nFg\\nc\\nAg\\ns\\nhw × hw\\n×\\n+\\nFg\\n×\\nwl\\nw\\nwg\\nchannel attention\\nspatial attention\\nfusion\\nlocal attention\\nglobal attention\\nFigure 1: Our global-local attention module (GLAM) involves both channel and spatial attention, as well as both local atten-\\ntion (channels/locations weighted independently, based on contextual information obtained by pooling) and global attention\\n(based on pairwise interaction between channels/locations).

Related work\\nInstance-level image retrieval\\nStudies on instance-level\\nimage retrieval can be roughly, but not exclusively, di-\\nvided into three types: (1) studies on global descriptors\\n[3, 16, 24, 53, 2, 37]; (2) studies on local descriptors and\\ngeometry-based re-ranking [29, 45, 40, 53]; (3) re-ranking\\nby graph-based methods [11, 21, 55]. The ﬁrst two types\\nof studies focus on the feature representation, while the last\\ntype focuses on re-ranking extracted features.\\nStudies on global descriptors focus on spatial pooling\\nof CNN feature maps into vectors, including MAC [38],\\nSPoC [2], CroW [24], R-MAC [48, 15, 16], GeM [37],\\nand NetVLAD [1, 25], as well as learning the representa-\\ntion [3, 15, 16, 36, 37]. Studies before deep learning dom-\\ninated image retrieval were mostly based on local descrip-\\ntors like SIFT [27] and bag-of-words representation [32] or\\naggregated descriptors like VLAD [22] or ASMK [46]. Lo-\\ncal descriptors have been revived in deep learning, e.g. with\\nDELF [29], DELG [5] and ASMK extensions [45, 47].\\nWe focus on learning a global descriptor in this work, be-\\ncause it is the most efﬁcient in terms of storage and search.\\nHowever, our generic attention mechanism produces a fea-\\nture tensor and could be applicable to local descriptors as\\nwell, if global pooling were replaced by local feature detec-\\ntion. Re-ranking methods are complementary to the repre-\\nsentation and we do not consider them in this work.\\nAttention\\nAttention mechanisms have been ﬁrst proposed\\nin image classiﬁcation studies focusing on channel at-\\nMETHOD\\nLOCAL\\nGLOBAL\\nLRN RET\\nSpatial Channel Spatial Channel\\nSENet [20]\\n✓\\n✓\\nECA-Net [51]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGCNet [6]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCBAM [54]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nGE [19]\\n✓\\n✓\\nNL-Net [52]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAA-Net [4]\\n✓\\n✓\\nSAN [59]\\n✓\\n✓\\nN3Net [34]\\n✓\\n✓\\nA2-Net [9]\\n✓\\n✓\\nGSoP [14]\\n✓\\n✓\\nOnA [23]\\n✓\\n✓\\nAGeM [17]\\n✓\\n✓\\nCroW [24]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nCRN [25]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELF [29]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nDELG [5]\\n✓\\n✓\\n✓\\nTolias et al.

CRN [25] ap-\\nplies spatial attention for feature reweighting and is learned.\\nLearned spatial attention mechanisms are common for local\\ndescriptors [29, 5, 47].\\nWe call the above methods local attention, in the sense\\nthat elements of the feature tensor (channels / spatial loca-\\ntions), are weighted independently, based on contextual in-\\nformation obtained by pooling or learned. By constrast, by\\nglobal attention we refer to mechanisms that model inter-\\naction between elements of the feature tensor, for example\\nbetween channels or between locations.\\nIn image classiﬁcation, non-local neural network (NL-\\nNet) [52] is maybe the ﬁrst global attention mechanism, fol-\\nlowed by similar studies [4, 59, 34]. It is global spatial at-\\ntention, allowing interaction between any pair of spatial lo-\\ncations. Similarly, there are studies of global channel atten-\\ntion, allowing interaction between channels [9, 14]. Global\\nattention has focused mostly on image recognition and has\\nbeen applied to either spatial or channel attention so far, not\\nboth. In image retrieval, SOLAR [28] is a direct application\\nof the global spatial attention mechanism of [52].\\nTable 1 attempts to categorize related work on atten-\\ntion according to whether attention is local or global, spa-\\ntial or channel, whether it is learned and whether it is ap-\\nplied to instance-level image retrieval. We observe that all\\nmethods limit to one or two forms of attention only. Of\\nthose studies that focus on image retrieval, many are not\\nlearned [23, 17, 24], and of those that are, some are de-\\nsigned for local descriptors [29, 47].\\nBy contrast, we provide a comprehensive study of all\\nforms of attention, global and local, spatial and channel, to\\nobtain a learned representation in the form of a tensor that\\ncan be used in any way. We spatially pool it into a global\\ndescriptor and we study the relative gain of different forms\\nof attention in image retrieval.\\nfeature map\\nconv 1 × 1\\nconv 3 × 3\\nconv 5 × 5\\nconv 7 × 7\\nconcat\\nconv 1 × 1\\nattention map\\nc × h × w\\n4c′ × h × w\\n1 × h × w\\nc′ × h × w\\ndilated\\nconv\\nF\\nF′\\nAl\\ns\\nFigure 3: Local spatial attention.

Global-local attention\\nWe design a global-local attention module (GLAM),\\nwhich is attached at the end of a backbone network. Figure 1\\nillustrates its main components. We are given a c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F, where c is the number of channels, and\\nh × w is the spatial resolution. Local attention collects con-\\ntext from the image and applies pooling to obtain a c×1×1\\nlocal channel attention map Al\\nc and a 1 × h × w local spa-\\ntial attention map Al\\ns. Global attention allows interaction\\nbetween channels, resulting in a c × c global channel at-\\ntention map Ag\\nc, and between spatial locations, resulting in\\na hw × hw global spatial attention map Ag\\ns. The feature\\nmaps produced by the two attention streams are combined\\nwith the original one by a learned fusion mechanism into\\nthe global-local attention feature map Fgl before being spa-\\ntially pooled into a global image descriptor.\\n3.1. Local attention\\nWe extract an 1D channel and a 2D spatial attention map\\nto weigh the feature map in the corresponding dimensions.\\nLocal channel attention\\nFollowing ECA-Net [51], this\\nattention captures local channel information. As shown in\\nFigure 2, we are given a c×h×w feature tensor F from our\\nbackbone. We ﬁrst reduce it to a c × 1 × 1 tensor by global\\naverage pooling (GAP). Channel attention is then captured\\nby a 1D convolution of kernel size k along the channel di-\\nmension, where k controls the extent of cross-channel inter-\\naction. This is followed by a sigmoid function, resulting in\\nthe c × 1 × 1 local channel attention map Al\\nc.\\nLocal spatial attention\\nInspired by the inception mod-\\nule [43] and similar to [25], this attention map captures local\\nspatial information at different scales.

We then extract local spatial\\ncontextual information using convolutional ﬁlters of kernel\\nsize 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7, which are efﬁciently imple-\\nmented by 3 × 3 dilated convolutions [7, 57] with dilation\\nparameter 1, 2, and 3 respectively. The resulting features,\\nalong with one obtained by 1 × 1 convolution on F′, are\\nconcatenated into a 4c′ × h × w tensor. Finally, we obtain\\nthe 1 × h × w local spatial attention map Al\\ns by a 1 × 1\\nconvolution that reduces the channel dimension to 1.\\nThe middle column of Figure 6 shows heat maps of local\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nLocal attention feature map\\nWe use the local channel\\nattention map Al\\nc to weigh F in the channel dimension\\nFl\\nc := F ⊙Al\\nc + F.\\n(1)\\nWe then use local spatial attention map Al\\ns to weigh Fl\\nc\\nin the spatial dimensions, resulting in the c × h × w local\\nattention feature map\\nFl = Fl\\nc ⊙Al\\ns + Fl\\nc.\\n(2)\\nHere, A⊙B denotes an element-wise multiplication of ten-\\nsors A and B, with broadcasting when one tensor is smaller.\\nWe adopt the choice of applying channel followed by spa-\\ntial attention from convolutional block attention module\\nCBAM [54]. However, apart from computing Al\\ns at differ-\\nent scales, both attention maps are obtained from the orig-\\ninal tensor F rather than sequentially. In addition, both (1)\\nand (2) include residual connections, while CBAM includes\\na single residual connection over both steps.\\n3.2.

This mechanism is based on the non-local neural net-\\nwork [52], but with the idea of 1D convolution from ECA-\\nNet [51]. As shown in Figure 4, we are given the c × h × w\\nfeature tensor F from our backbone. We apply GAP and\\nsqueeze spatial dimensions, followed by a 1D convolution\\nof kernel size k and a sigmoid function, to obtain 1×c query\\nQc and key Kc tensors. The value tensor Vc is obtained by\\nmere reshaping of F to hw×c, without GAP. Next, we form\\nthe outer product of Kc and Qc, followed by softmax over\\nchannels to obtain a c × c global channel attention map\\nAg\\nc = softmax(Kc\\n⊤Qc).\\n(3)\\nFinally, this attention map is multiplied with Vc and the ma-\\ntrix product VcAg\\nc is reshaped back to c×h×w to give the\\nglobal channel attention feature map Gc. In GSoP [14] and\\nA2-Net [9], a c×c global channel attention map is obtained\\nby multiplication of hw × c matrices; (3) is more efﬁcient,\\nusing only an outer product of 1 × c vectors.\\nGlobal spatial attention\\nSince ordinary convolution ap-\\nplies only a local neighborhood at a time, it cannot capture\\nglobal contextual information. Thus, we apply non-local ﬁl-\\ntering [52], which is a form of self-attention [49] in the spa-\\ntial dimensions. As shown in Figure 5, we are given the\\nsame c × h × w feature tensor F from our backbone. By\\nusing three 1×1 convolutions, which reduce channels to c′,\\nand ﬂattening spatial dimensions to hw, we obtain c′ × hw\\nquery Qs, key Ks, and value Vs tensors, where each col-\\numn is a feature vector corresponding to a particular spatial\\nlocation. We capture pairwise similarities of these vectors\\nby matrix multiplication of Ks and Qs, followed by soft-\\nmax over locations to obtain a hw × hw global spatial at-\\ntention map:\\nAg\\ns = softmax(K⊤\\ns Qs).\\n(4)\\n4\\nThis attention map is multiplied with Vs and the matrix\\nproduct VsAg\\ns is reshaped back to c′ ×h×w by expanding\\nthe spatial dimensions. Finally, using a 1 × 1 convolution,\\nwhich increases channels back to c, we obtain the c×h×w\\nglobal spatial attention feature map Gs.\\nThe right column of Figure 6 shows heat maps for global\\nspatial attention, localizing target objects in images.\\nGlobal attention feature map\\nWe use the global channel\\nattention feature map Fc to weigh F element-wise\\nFg\\nc = F ⊙Gc.\\n(5)\\nWe then use global spatial attention feature map Gs to\\nweigh Fg\\nc element-wise, resulting in the c × h × w global\\nattention feature map\\nFg = Fg\\nc ⊙Gs + Fg\\nc.\\n(6)\\nSimilarly to Fl in (1) and (2), we apply channel attention\\nﬁrst, followed by spatial attention. However, unlike (1),\\nthere is no residual connection in (5). This choice is sup-\\nported by early experiments.\\n3.3. Global-local attention\\nFeature fusion\\nAs shown in Figure 1, we combine the\\nlocal and global attention feature maps, Fl and Fg, with\\nthe original feature F. While concatenation and summation\\nare common operations for feature combination, we use a\\nweighted average with weights wl, wg, w respectively, ob-\\ntained by softmax over three learnable scalar parameters, to\\nobtain a c × h × w global-local attention feature map\\nFgl = wlFl + wgFl + wF.\\n(7)\\nEfﬁcientDet [44] has shown that this is the most effective,\\namong a number of choices, for fusion of features across\\ndifferent scales.\\nPooling\\nWe apply GeM [37], a learnable spatial pooling\\nmechanism, to feature map Fgl (7), followed by a fully-\\nconnected (FC) layer with dropout and batch normalization.\\nThe ﬁnal embedding is obtained by ℓ2-normalization.\\n4.

The clean datasets\\nfocus on views directly relevant to landmark recognition but\\nhave a much smaller number of images.\\nEvaluation set and metrics\\nWe use four common eval-\\nuation datasets for landmark image retrieval: Oxford5k\\n(Ox5k) [32], Paris6k (Par6k) [33], as well as Revisited Ox-\\nford (ROxford or ROxf) and Paris (RParis or RPar) [35].\\nROxford and RParis are used with and without one million\\ndistractors (R1M) [28] and evaluated using the Medium and\\nHard protocols [35]. We evaluate using mean Average Pre-\\ncision (mAP) and mean precision at 10 (mP@10).\\n4.2. Implementation details\\nWe train on 8 TITAN RTX 2080Ti GPUs. All models are\\npre-trained on ImageNet [39] and implemented in PyTorch\\n[31]. For fair comparisons, we set a training environment\\n5\\nFigure 7: Examples of our ranking results.

The kernel\\nsize k of ECANet in subsection 3.1 is set to 3. The param-\\neter p of GeM in subsection 3.3 is set to 3 and the dimen-\\nsion d of ﬁnal embeddings to 512. We adopt ArcFace [10],\\na cosine-softmax based loss, with a margin of 0.3. We use\\nstochastic gradient descent with initial learning rate 10−3,\\nmomentum 0.9 and weight decay 10−5.\\nWe adopt the batch sampling of Yokoo et al. [56] where\\nmini-batch samples with similar aspect ratios are resized to\\na particular size. Here, we use a batch size of 64. For image\\naugmentation, we apply scaling, random cropping, and var-\\nied illumination. At inference, we apply a multi-resolution\\nrepresentation [16] to query and database images.\\nOur method is denoted as GLAM (global-local atten-\\ntion module). Using the backbone model alone is referred\\nto as baseline. It is compatible with recent models based\\non ResNet101-GeM trained with ArcFace [53, 28]. Adding\\nour local attention (subsection 3.1) to the baseline model is\\ndenoted +local, while adding our global attention (subsec-\\ntion 3.2) is denoted +global. Since we focus on representa-\\ntion learning, we do not consider post-processing methods\\nlike geometry-based re-ranking [29, 40, 53] or graph-based\\nre-ranking [11, 21, 55].\\n4.3.

To achieve best possible performance, we use\\nGLDv2-clean as a training set in the remaining experiments.\\nComparisons on same training set\\nIt is common to com-\\npare methods regardless of training sets as more become\\navailable, e.g., [35, 28]. Since GLDv2-clean is relatively\\nnew, Weyand et al. [53], which introduced the dataset, is the\\nonly study that has trained the same backbone with the same\\nsettings (ResNet101-GeM with ArcFace) on GLDv2-clean.\\nOur baseline is lower than [53], because our dimensinality is\\n512, while other models based on ResNet101 use 2048. Yet,\\nTable 3 shows that our best model trained on GLDv2-clean\\noutperforms [53] by a large margin. But the most impor-\\ntant comparison is with SOLAR [28], also based on self-\\nattention, which has trained ResNet101-GeM on GLDv1-\\nnoisy. On this training set, our best model clearly outper-\\nforms [28] despite lower dimensionality.\\nComparison with state of the art\\nTable 4 shows the\\nperformance of four variants of our model, i.e. baseline\\nwith or without local/global attention, and compares them\\nagainst state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on global de-\\nscriptors without re-ranking on the complete set of bench-\\nmarks, including distractors. Both local and global atten-\\ntion bring signiﬁcant gain over the baseline. The effect\\nof global is stronger, while the gain of the two is addi-\\ntive in the combination.

Table 5 shows the results, which are more ﬁne-\\ngrained than those of Table 4. In particular, it shows the ef-\\nfect of the channel and spatial variants of both local and\\nglobal attention. We observe that, when used alone, the\\nchannel and spatial variants of local attention are harmful\\nin most cases. Even the combination, baseline+local, is not\\nalways effective. By contrast, when used alone, the channel\\nand spatial variants of global attention are mostly beneﬁcial,\\nespecially the latter. Their combination, baseline+global, is\\nimpressive, bringing gain of up to 7.5%. Importantly, the\\ncombination baseline+global+local improves further by up\\nto another 2.8%. This result shows the necessity of local\\nattention in the ﬁnal model.\\nCBAM vs. our local spatial attention\\nWe experiment\\nwith the local spatial attention of CBAM [54]. CBAM ap-\\nplies average and max-pooling to input features and con-\\ncatenates the two for spatial attention. We apply this vari-\\nant to our local spatial attention module for comparison.\\nFor the CBAM style module, we keep the overall design\\nof our module as shown in Figure 3, but apply average and\\nmax-pooling to each of the four convolutional layer outputs\\nbefore concatenation. Table 6 shows that the CBAM style\\nmodule is considerably worse than ours on all benchmarks\\nexcept Paris6k, where it is only slightly better.\\nConcatenation vs. sum for feature fusion\\nWe use a\\nsoftmax-based weighted average of local and global atten-\\ntion feature maps with the original feature map (7). Here,\\nwe compare this weighted average with weighted concate-\\nnation, where concatenation replaces the sum operation\\nin (7). As shown in Table 7, the weighted average outper-\\nforms the weighted concatenation.\\nFixed-size vs. group-size sampling\\nNumerous studies\\nhave proposed methods for constructing batches according\\nto image size for efﬁcient training. For instance, Gordo et\\nal. [16], DELF [29], and Yokoo et al. [56] employed dif-\\nferent image sizes per batch for training instead of a single\\nﬁxed size. We adopt the method of Yokoo et al., which con-\\nstructs a batch with images of similar aspect ratio, so that\\nthe images can be resized to a size with an aspect ratio that\\nis similar to their own. We call this method group-size sam-\\npling. Table 8 compares ﬁxed-size (224 × 224) with group-\\nsize sampling. We observe that maintaining aspect ratios by\\nusing dynamic input sizes is much more effective.\\nMulti-resolution\\nWe use the multi-resolution representa-\\ntion [16] for the ﬁnal feature of an image at inference time.\\nThis method: (1) resizes an image into multiple scales; (2)\\nextracts features from the resized images; and (3) averages\\nthe features to obtain the ﬁnal feature of the image. The\\nmethod is applied to both query and database images to en-\\nhance ranking results, especially for small target objects.\\nTable 9 compares the four cases of applying this method or\\nnot to query or database images.\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe have introduced a novel approach that extracts global\\nand local contextual information using attention mecha-\\nnisms for instance-level image retrieval. It is manifested as\\na network architecture consisting of global and local atten-\\ntion components, each operating on both spatial and chan-\\nnel dimensions. This constitutes a comprehensive study and\\nempirical evaluation of all four forms of attention that have\\npreviously been studied only in isolation. Our ﬁndings indi-\\ncate that the gain (or loss) brought by one form of attention\\nalone strongly depends on the presence of the others, with\\nthe maximum gain appearing when all forms are present.\\nThe output is a modiﬁed feature tensor that can be used in\\nany way, for instance with local feature detection instead of\\nspatial pooling for image retrieval.\\nWith the advent of vision transformers [12, 58] and their\\nrecent application to image retrieval [13], attention is ex-\\npected to play a more and more signiﬁcant role in vi-\\nsion. According to our classiﬁcation, transformers perform\\nglobal spatial attention alone. It is of great interest to in-\\nvestigate the role of the other forms of attention, where our\\n8\\napproach may yield a basic building block of such archi-\\ntectures. One may even envision an extension to language\\nmodels, where transformers originate from [50].\\nReferences\\n[1] Relja Arandjelovi´c, Petr Gronat, Akihiko Torii, Tomas Pa-\\njdla, and Josef Sivic.\\nNetVLAD: CNN architecture for\\nweakly supervised place recognition.

Many data driven applications involve processing\\nmassive timeseries data, including IoT [11], medical AI [14], stock\\nmarket [27], and so on. As such, there is a great need for timeseries\\nanalytics, such as forecasting [8], classification [20], clustering [31],\\nsimilarity search [39], and anomaly detection [50], with applications\\nranging from automatically diagnosing diseases [5], recognizing\\nhuman activities [29], to stopping financial fraud [59].\\nEffective feature extraction [40] lies at the core of almost all\\nthese timeseries analytics tasks. Recently researchers [61] have\\nstarted leveraging the self-supervised pre-training methodology of\\nTransformers [4, 16, 52], which have proven remarkably successful\\nin natural language processing (NLP), to automatically learn high\\nquality feature embeddings from timeseries. In NLP, self-supervised\\npre-training exploits the sequential patterns (correlations) among\\nthe words in sentences to produce contextualized feature embed-\\ndings. Timeseries bear similarity to natural language, because in\\ntimeseries data the sequential order among the values (stock price,\\nvolume, etc.) over time matters. That is, each value is highly cor-\\nrelated with other values observed before or after it. Therefore,\\n∗Corresponding Author\\npre-training a Transformer model which takes the correlations\\namong different observations into account is a natural idea to learn\\nfeature embeddings from timeseries. Indeed, the experiments in [61]\\nconfirm that Transformer-based methods outperform traditional\\ntimeseries analytics techniques.\\nHowever, existing work [61] that directly applies Transformers\\nto learn features from timeseries data have been shown not to be\\nscalable to long timeseries [30]. The idea of self-attention [52] is\\ncentral to pre-training methods in NLP: It computes pairwise cor-\\nrelations among different semantic units in a sequence (in NLP, a\\nsentence); as such, it has quadratic time and space complexity in\\nthe length of the input sequence. Such an approach places limits on\\nthe model’s scalability, especially when handling large sequences,\\nwhich are common in real-world timeseries applications such as\\nIoT, medical AI, and finance [6, 34, 62]. Predictions about timeseries\\nmay need to look at months or years of historical data to make ac-\\ncurate predictions, spanning hundreds of thousands of samples. As\\nan example, in collaboration with a research hospital we have been\\ndeveloping a seizure classifier that automatically detects seizures\\nbased on EEG signals (timeseries) collected during the clinical ob-\\nservation of patients. As seizures last only a few seconds, we chunk\\nlong EEG data into many 2 second segments and detect seizures at\\na segment level. However, the classification of a particular segment\\ndepends on up to 12 hours of prior signal to determine if one 2\\nsecond segment indicates seizure or not, because seizure diagnosis\\nneeds to consider long-term trends in the EEG data [6]. The number\\nof segments in 12 hours is more than 21k. This is far larger than\\nthe number of semantic units the typical NLP tasks expect. For\\nexample, BERT [16] limits the number of units to 512 and even\\nmassive models like GPT-3 [4] limit the number of units to 2048.\\nAlthough in NLP some lower-complexity methods have been\\nproposed to approximately compute self-attention [10, 26, 54], their\\nperformance degrades dramatically when used on timeseries, due\\nto the gap between natural language and timeseries, as we will\\nshow in our experiments.\\nProposed Approach. To tackle the aforementioned problem, we\\ndevelop RITA, a Transformer-based timeseries analytics tool, which\\nuses a novel attention mechanism, called group attention, to scale\\nto long timeseries.\\nLeveraging the periodicity of timeseries, RITA chunks the input\\ntimeseries into segments and dynamically clusters the segments\\ninto a small number (denoted as 𝑁) of groups. Segments in the\\nsame group possess similar feature embeddings during the current\\ntraining iteration, thus enabling them to approximately share the\\n1\\narXiv:2306.01926v1  [cs.LG]  2 Jun 2023\\ncomputation of attention. As the timeseries increases in length,\\nmore sharing opportunities become available. RITA then computes\\nthe self-attention at a group level and produces a compressed group\\nattention matrix. In this way, group attention eliminates both com-\\nputation and memory bottlenecks in Transformer-style models and\\nthus more scalable to long timeseries.\\nHowever, making this idea effective and efficient in Transformer\\narchitectures is challenging for several reasons:\\n• Efficiently Producing High Quality Feature Embeddings.\\nAlthough RITA computes the attention matrix at a group level, to\\npreserve the quality of the feature embeddings, it still has to pro-\\nduce different embeddings for different segments. This is because\\neven if some segments share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding. However,\\nusing the group attention matrix, the existing self-attention mech-\\nanism will only produce a single feature vector for each group. A\\nnaive solution would be to restore the original attention matrix\\nfrom the group attention matrix. However, in this case we again\\nget an attention matrix with quadratic space complexity. Because\\nGPUs have limited memory, GPU memory will remain a bottleneck\\nin group attention.\\n• The Number of Groups N. In RITA, the number of groups\\n𝑁is a crucial factor that balances the speed up and the quality of\\nattention approximation. A small 𝑁will lead to a large speedup,\\nbut the approximation errors can also be significant. On the other\\nhand, although a large 𝑁tends to produce high-quality approxima-\\ntions, it inevitably slows down the training process. Therefore, an\\nappropriate 𝑁is essential to the performance of group attention.\\nHowever, 𝑁depends on the distributional properties of the dataset.\\nFurthermore, like the classical transformer models, RITA stacks\\nmultiple attention layers to produce better embeddings. Ideally,\\ndifferent layers should also use different values of 𝑁. In addition,\\nduring the model training phrase, group attention should use dif-\\nferent values of 𝑁at different iterations to adapt to the varying\\nfeature embeddings. This makes manually setting appropriate 𝑁\\nalmost impossible.\\n• Batch Size. Moreover, as we want to dynamically adjust 𝑁\\nduring training, a fixed batch size is sub-optimal: as 𝑁decreases,\\nthe memory usage of a single sample decreases. This allows a larger\\nbatch size which is beneficial, because: (1) it makes full use of GPU\\nmemory; (2) high-parallelism across the samples in a big batch\\nbrings better performance. Our experimental study shows that\\ndoubling the batch size reduces the training time by 30%, while still\\npreserving the quality of the model. Thus, RITA should dynamically\\nadjust batch size as 𝑁changes.\\nTo address the above problems, we first propose an embedding\\naggregation strategy and a customized group softmax function to\\nreplace the classical softmax function [52]. Together they ensure\\nRITA is able to directly use the compressed attention matrix to\\nproduce different feature embeddings for different segments. We\\ntheoretically show the embeddings RITA produces in this way are\\nidentical to those produced by first re-storing the original large\\nattention matrix. Thus RITA is able to produce high quality embed-\\ndings without introducing extra overhead. Further, we design a GPU\\nfriendly algorithm to group the segments in parallel, effectively\\nminimizing the grouping cost.\\nP0\\nPosition\\nEmbedding\\nW1\\n+\\n+\\n+\\nWindow \\nEmbedding\\n+\\nE0\\nRaw\\nTimeseries\\nTime-aware \\nConvolution\\nW[CLS]\\nW2\\n⊗\\n.....\\nWn\\nP1\\nP2\\n.....\\nPn\\n.....\\nE1\\nE2\\nEn\\n.....\\nO0\\nO1\\nO2\\nOn\\n.....\\nRITA Encoder\\nScale & Input\\nFigure 1: RITA Architecture\\nSecond, we design an adaptive scheduler which dynamically de-\\ncides an appropriate 𝑁for each group attention layer during the\\ntraining process. It starts with a large 𝑁and iteratively merges\\ngroups that are similar to each other. Guided by an error bound on\\nthe approximated self-attention that users can tolerate, it automati-\\ncally determines if two groups are mergeable, performing merging\\nefficiently in a GPU-friendly way.\\nMoreover, we propose a learning-based method to model the\\ncorrelation between the number of groups 𝑁and the batch size 𝐵.\\nThis model is used to predict 𝐵for a given 𝑁when training RITA.\\nSpecifically, we first sample some 𝑁values in a reasonable range.\\nFor each sampled 𝑁, we find a batch size that consumes up to a\\ncertain percentage of GPU memory in a cost-efficient way. Using a\\nsmall set of mathematical functions as a prior, RITA learns a model\\nwith only a few <N, B> pairs as ground truth labels.\\nOur experiments on public timeseries benchmarks and the MGH\\nEEG data [6] confirm that RITA outperforms state-of-the-art meth-\\nods in accuracy on various timeseries analytics tasks, while our\\ngroup attention mechanism achieves a 63X speedup with much\\nless memory required, compared to existing self-attention mecha-\\nnisms [10, 52, 54].\\nContributions. The key contributions of this work include:\\n• Our group attention mechanism leverages the periodicity of\\ntimeseries, reducing the time and space complexity of the self-\\nattention mechanism with accuracy guarantees, allowing RITA to\\nscale to long timeseries data.\\n• Guided by an approximation error bound, our adaptive sched-\\nuler dynamically adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nto the distribution properties of the evolving feature embeddings,\\nmaking group attention efficient and easily tunable.\\n• We conduct experiments on various datasets and different ana-\\nlytics tasks, demonstrating that RITA is 4 to 63 times faster than\\nthe state-of-the-art while achieving better accuracy when handling\\nlong timeseries (length ≥2000).\\n2\\n2\\nBACKGROUND\\nWe provide some background on the canonical self-attention mod-\\nule in the Transformer[52]. A self-attention module takes 𝑛hidden\\nembedding vectors 𝐻∈R𝑛∗𝑑ℎas input, then projects them to\\nqueries (𝑄), keys (𝐾) and values (𝑉) and performs Scaled-dot Prod-\\nuct Attention, which given input hidden state 𝐻, is computed by:\\n𝑄= 𝐻𝑊𝑄, 𝐾= 𝐻𝑊𝐾,𝑉= 𝐻𝑊𝑉\\n𝑂= 𝐴𝑉= 𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥( 𝑄𝐾𝑇\\n√︁\\n𝑑𝑘\\n)𝑉\\n(1)\\nWhere 𝑊𝑄∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝐾∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑘,𝑊𝑉∈R𝑑ℎ∗𝑑𝑣are projection\\nmatrices for generating 𝑄, 𝐾,𝑉. 𝑄∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘is also regarded as the\\npacking of 𝑛query vectors {𝑞1, ...,𝑞𝑛} with dimension 𝑑𝑘into a\\nmatrix. 𝐾∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑘,𝑉∈R𝑛∗𝑑𝑣are regarded as the packing of key\\nvectors {𝑘1, ...,𝑘𝑛} and value vectors {𝑣1, ..., 𝑣𝑛} in the same way.\\nGiven a matrix 𝑀∈R𝐿∗𝑛, the softmax function normalizes 𝑀\\nto ensure the sum of each row equals to 1, as shown below.\\n𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(𝑀𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑛−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑀𝑖,𝑘)\\n(2)\\nNote the attention matrix A is an 𝑛×𝑛matrix, where 𝑛represents\\nthe number of elements in the input sequence (e.g. words in NLP).\\n3\\nRITA OVERVIEW\\nGiven a collection of unlabeled timeseries, RITA first pre-trains\\na Transformer-style model to produce high quality feature em-\\nbeddings for timeseries data. This pre-trained model is then used\\nto support various downstream tasks, similar to BERT [16]. Next,\\nwe overview the model architecture of RITA. We show how RITA\\nsupports various downstream tasks in Appendix A.7.\\nAs shown in Fig. 1, RITA is consist of two components: (1) Time-\\naware Convolution Layer (2) RITA Encoder.\\nTime-aware Convolution Layer fills the gap between timeseries\\nand natural language. Despite their high-level similarity, there is a\\nbig gap between timeseries and natural language. First, in natural\\nlanguage each word, as a discrete semantic unit, has an indepen-\\ndent meaning, while each element in a timeseries is a continuous,\\nnumerical value and does not necessarily constitute an independent\\nevent. Furthermore, the input sequences are single-channeled in\\nNLP, but often multi-channeled in timeseries (i.e., sensor data often\\nconsists of several related channels).\\nRITA leverages the classical convolution [28] strategy to solve\\nthis problem. Convolution is widely used to capture the local struc-\\ntures of an image. We use convolution to chunk one input timeseries\\ninto a sequence of windows and learn the local structure of each\\nwindow, similar to the discrete semantic units in natural language.\\nIt also discovers the correlations across different channels, thus\\nnaturally solving the multi-channel problem.\\nMore specifically, treating a multi-variate timeseries of length 𝑛\\nand with𝑚variables as an n × m matrix𝑇, RITA uses𝑑convolution\\nkernels to chunk𝑇into n windows and produce one d-dimensional\\nembedding per window using the convolution operation [28]. Each\\nconvolution kernel corresponds to a w × m matrix, where 𝑤defines\\nthe number of timestamps that each convolution kernel covers,\\nidentical to the window size in sliding window.\\nRITA Encoder functions as Transformer Encoder as described in\\nthe original Transformer work[52]. It takes the embeddings of 𝑛\\nsemantic units 𝑋1,𝑋2, ...,𝑋𝑛(𝑋𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as input (e.g. embeddings of\\n𝑛windows for a timeseries), then models the correlations between\\nthe semantic units and outputs 𝑌1, ...,𝑌𝑛(𝑌𝑖∈𝑅𝑑) as the context-\\naware embedding of each unit.\\nWhat makes RITA Encoder different from Transformer Encoder\\nis that: at the core of Transformer Encoder lies self-attention mech-\\nanism which incurs a 𝑂(𝑛2) time complexity and memory usage.\\nThis quadratic cost becomes prohibitive for long timeseries and\\nlimits the scalablity of Transformer-based models. To make the\\nattention computation efficient yet high-quality, we replace the\\ncanonical self-attention with our proposed group attention.\\nSelf-supervised Pretraining. Inspired by the “cloze text” pre-\\ntraining task in NLP, we designed a mask-and-predict task as the\\npretraining task for our model. The timeseries is randomly masked\\nand the model should recover the masked values based on corre-\\nsponding contextual information.\\nTo be specific, we generate masks on time-stamps, with a mask\\nrate 𝑝. The timeseries is scaled to be non-negative and the values\\nacross all the channels on the masked timestamps are set to be -1,\\nan impossible value on normal timestamps. Then the masked time-\\nseries is fed into RITA and the output representation is translated\\nto the recovered timeseries by a Transpose Convolution layer.\\n4\\nGROUP ATTENTION MECHANISM\\nGroup attention, a novel and efficient approximate attention mecha-\\nnism, addresses the performance bottleneck of self-attention in the\\nvanilla Transformer. In this section, we first introduce the frame-\\nwork of group attention and then theoretically establish the bound\\nof its approximation error.\\n4.1\\nThe Idea of Group Attention\\nAs periodicity is a natural property of timeseries [56], similar\\nwindows frequently occur. Similar windows result in similar\\nqueries/keys for attention computation, bringing opportunities for\\nsaving computation.\\nAs discussed in Sec. 2, 𝐴𝑖𝑗, the attention score of window 𝑖onto\\nwindow 𝑗, is determined by the inner product between the query\\nvector of window 𝑖and the key vector of window 𝑗, that is, 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗.\\nGiven another window 𝑥, if window 𝑥has the similar key vector\\nto window 𝑗, that is, 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥, then 𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑗≈𝑞𝑖· 𝑘𝑥. In other words,\\n𝐴𝑖𝑗≈𝐴𝑖𝑥when 𝑘𝑗≈𝑘𝑥.\\nThis observation inspires our group attention mechanism. That\\nis, we group the windows by their similarity in keys. Assuming\\nall windows in the same group have the same attention score onto\\nanother window 𝑘, we then only compute the attention once by\\nusing one single key to represent this group, for example the centroid\\nof the group of keys. This thus saves significant computation cost.\\nBetter yet, after grouping 𝑛windows into 𝑁groups, group atten-\\ntion compresses the attention matrix from an𝑛×𝑛matrix to an𝑛×𝑁\\nmatrix. Because 𝑁(number of groups) tends to be much smaller\\nthan 𝑛(number of windows) due to the periodicity of timeseries,\\ngroup attention consumes much less memory than the original\\nself-attention mechanism, successfully eliminating the memory\\nbottleneck. Note that it also doesn’t hurt quality all that much, as\\nconfirmed in our experiments (Sec. 6.2).\\n3\\nGrouping\\nAverage\\nK\\nQ\\nMatMul\\nAttention Matrix\\nWeighted\\nSoftMax\\nV\\nSum\\nAggregate\\nTranspose\\nMatMul\\nOutput\\nQ \\nK \\nV\\nFigure 2: Group Attention\\n4.2\\nComputing the Output Feature Embedding\\nWe now discuss how to efficiently compute the output feature\\nembeddings using the small compressed group attention matrix.\\n4.2.1\\nProblem: Producing Embeddings w/ Group Attention Matrix\\nAs described in the Background, once we have acquired the at-\\ntention matrix 𝐴, canonical self-attention computes the output\\nembedding 𝑂as O = AV. Because 𝐴is an 𝑛× 𝑛matrix and 𝑉is an\\n𝑛×𝑑𝑣matrix, the matrix product operation still produces an 𝑛×𝑑𝑣\\nmatrix 𝑂. That is, it produces a 𝑑𝑣dimensional feature vector for\\neach window. However, our group attention will produce an 𝑛× 𝑁\\nattention matrix e\\n𝐴, where 𝑁corresponds to the number of groups.\\nIn this case the matrix product will produce a 𝑁×𝑑𝑣matrix e\\n𝑂. That\\nis, it produces a feature vector for each group. However, our goal\\nis to produce different embeddings for different windows, because\\neven if some windows share the attention score temporally, it does\\nnot mean they should have the same feature embedding.\\nA Naive Solution. A naive solution would be to restore the full\\nattention matrix 𝐴from the group attention matrix e\\n𝐴. For example,\\ngiven one group composed of 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗, we map its group\\nattention vector in e\\n𝐴into two rows that correspond to 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖and\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑗in 𝐴. However, in this case we again get a 𝑛× 𝑛attention\\nmatrix; and GPU memory remains a bottleneck in group attention.\\n4.2.2\\nSolution: Embedding Aggregation and Group SoftMax\\nUsing an embedding aggregation operation and a group softmax\\nfunction, RITA produces 𝑛embeddings without restoring the full\\nattention matrix. Fig. 2 shows the workflow of group attention.\\nEmbedding Aggregation. The idea is inspired by the observation\\non the matrix product operation O = AV conducted on the fully\\nrestored attention matrix 𝐴.\\nGiven an element𝑂𝑖,𝑗of𝑂corresponding to the 𝑗𝑡ℎdimension of\\n𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖’s feature vector,𝑂𝑖,𝑗= 𝑎𝑖·𝑣𝑗, where vector ai ∈Rn denotes the\\n𝑖𝑡ℎrow of the attention matrix 𝐴and vector vj ∈Rn denotes the 𝑗𝑡ℎ\\ndimension of all the 𝑛feature vectors. Given ai =< a1\\ni , a2\\ni , · · · , an\\ni >\\nand vj =< v1\\nj , v2\\nj , · · · , vn\\nj >, 𝑂𝑖,𝑗= Ín\\nk=1 ak\\ni vk\\nj .\\nAs an example, assume 𝑤𝑖𝑛1 and 𝑤𝑖𝑛2 belong to the same group\\n𝐺1. Then 𝑎1\\n𝑖= 𝑎2\\n𝑖= e𝑎1\\n𝑖, where e𝑎1\\n𝑖∈e\\n𝐴corresponds to the attention\\nof group 𝐺1 onto 𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖. Therefore, 𝑎1\\n𝑖𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑎2\\n𝑖𝑣2\\n𝑗= e𝑎1\\n𝑖(𝑣1\\n𝑗+ 𝑣2\\n𝑗).\\nAs an immediate generalization of the above analysis, if we ag-\\ngregate up the windows that belong to the same group and convert\\nthe n-dimensional feature vector 𝑣𝑗into a 𝑁-dimensional group fea-\\nture vectore𝑣𝑗beforehand, we could directly use the group attention\\nvector e𝑎𝑖and the group feature vector e𝑣𝑗to compute 𝑂𝑖,𝑗.\\nUsing embedding aggregation, RITA is able to produce the fea-\\nture embedding e\\n𝑂that is identical to the embedding 𝑂produced\\nby using the full attention matrix 𝐴and the embedding matrix 𝑉.\\nGroup Softmax Function. In canonical self-attention the atten-\\ntion matrix 𝐴is computed as 𝐴= SoftMax( QKT\\n√\\ndk ). To compute 𝐴,\\nwe have to first compute 𝑄𝐾𝑇(denoted as 𝑃) which is an 𝑛× 𝑛\\nmatrix. Then normalizing the 𝑃matrix with softmax produces the\\nattention matrix 𝐴.\\nGroup attention follows the same procedure. But after grouping\\nkeys into e𝐾, 𝑄e𝐾𝑇produces an 𝑛× 𝑁matrix e𝑃. Due to the non-\\nlinearity of the softmax function, applying softmax directly on e𝑃\\nwill result in a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴from which we are not able\\nto recover a full attention matrix that is identical to first restoring\\ne𝑃to 𝑃and then applying softmax on 𝑃. The 𝐴matrix produced\\nby the latter is desirable, as we want to approximate the original\\nattention matrix as accurately as possible. However, restoring the\\nsmall 𝑛× 𝑁e𝑃matrix is not memory efficient, as it will end up with\\na full 𝑛× 𝑛matrix 𝑃.\\nTo solve the above problems, we introduce a new group softmax\\nfunction to replace the original softmax function (Eq. 2).\\n𝐺𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑆𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑀𝑎𝑥(g\\n𝑃𝑖,𝑗) =\\n𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑗)\\nÍ𝑁−1\\n𝑘=0 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑃𝑖,𝑘)\\n(3)\\nIn Eq. 3, 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘represents the number of windows that Group\\n𝐺𝑘contains. Compared to the original softmax, our group softmax\\nconsiders each group 𝐺𝑘as 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘elements and counts it 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑘\\ntimes when summing up the exponential of each group’s 𝑃𝑖,𝑘. In\\nthis way, the group softmax function operating on the small e𝑃\\nmatrix will produce exactly the same result to the softmax function\\noperating on the full 𝑃matrix.\\nTheoretical Guarantee. In Appendix A.4, we prove that the group\\nsoftmax function and the embedding aggregation operation produce\\nthe same output feature embedding with the naive method that has\\nto first restore the big full attention matrix.\\nWe show an efficient implementation of the embedding aggrega-\\ntion operation and group softmax function in Appendix A.2, Alg. 1.\\nTime Complexity. The time complexity of Alg. 1 is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁𝑑) and\\nthe space complexity is𝑂(𝑛𝑁), while the time and space complexity\\nof the original self-attention mechanism are 𝑂(𝑛2𝑑) and 𝑂(𝑛2).\\n4.3\\nError Bound\\nGroup attention produces a group attention matrix e\\n𝐴which approxi-\\nmates the attention matrix𝐴produced by the classical self-attention\\nwith a bounded error, as shown in Lemma 1.\\nLemma 1. Let 𝑅be the radius of the ball where all key vectors\\nlive; e𝑘𝑖be the representative of the group that contains key 𝑘𝑖. Let 𝐴\\ndenote the full attention matrix restored from e\\n𝐴. Suppose the distance\\nbetween e𝑘𝑖and 𝑘𝑖(||ek𝑖−k𝑖||) satisfies: ||ek𝑖−k𝑖|| ≤d.\\nThen ∀𝜖> 1, if d ≤ln(𝜖)\\n2R , 1\\n𝜖≤Ai,j\\nAi,j ≤𝜖\\nLemma 1 shows that the error bound 𝜖of the group attention is\\ndetermined by the distance 𝑑. As discussed in Sec. 5.1, it inspires\\nus to design a strategy to dynamically determine the number of\\ngroups 𝑁– the most critical parameter of group attention. Please\\nrefer to Appendix A.5 for the proof.\\n4\\n4.4\\nGPU Friendly Grouping Method\\nIn this section, we discuss the implementation of a grouping method.\\nTo make group attention efficient and effective, the grouping\\nmethod has to satisfy the following requirements:\\n(1) Tight distance bound: to ensure the approximation quality,\\nthe distance between each key and its group representative should\\nbe minimized according to Lemma 1.\\n(2) Lightweight: to ensure the performance gain, the grouping\\nmethod must be lightweight, at worst not exceeding the complexity\\nof group attention itself (𝑂(𝑁𝑛)).\\n(3) GPU friendly: to take advantage of GPUs, we prefer a group-\\ning method that mainly consists of matrix operations, which can\\nbe efficiently executed on a GPU.\\nTo satisfy the above requirements, after thorough investigation\\non various clustering algorithms, we design a GPU friendly K-\\nmeans [35] as the grouping method.\\nFirst, K-means minimizes the overall distance between any object\\nand its cluster center, hence naturally satisfying Requirement 1.\\nSecond, given 𝑁centers, in each iteration the time and space\\ncomplexity of K-means is 𝑂(𝑛𝑁). Usually, the iteration goes until\\nconvergence. However, we observe that rather than seeking a per-\\nfect K-means clustering, training a few iterations is sufficient to\\nget a good grouping for group attention, because typically the later\\niterations only slightly update the clustering and group attention\\nis robust to such imperfection.\\nThird, we design a GPU-friendly implementation of K-means.\\nThe performance bottleneck of K-means comes from the dis-\\ntance computation between each vector and its center, that is,\\n|vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n(vi −cj)2, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. The performance bot-\\ntleneck is 𝑣𝑖−𝑐𝑗. We instead use a different formulation: |𝑣𝑖−\\n𝑐𝑗| = |vi −cj| =\\n√︃\\n|vi|2 + |cj|2 −2vi · cj, i ∈[1, n], j ∈[1, N]. This is\\nbecause in this formulation, the performance bottleneck is 𝑣𝑖· 𝑐𝑗,\\nwhich could be implemented as a matrix product operation. Al-\\nthough the complexity of the two formulations is the same, in GPUs\\nmatrix product is much more efficient than pairwise difference.\\n5\\nADAPTIVE SCHEDULER\\nNext, we present the adaptive scheduler of RITA which addresses\\nthe challenges of determining an appropriate number of groups\\n𝑁and accordingly the batch size 𝐵, as described in Introduction.\\nUsing a dynamic scheduling method we propose, the scheduler\\nautomatically determines and adjusts 𝑁and 𝐵based on the distri-\\nbutional properties of the feature embeddings produced over the\\niterative training process, while guaranteed to produce high quality\\nattention approximation that meets the requirement of users.\\nIn Sec. 5.1 we show how RITA automatically determines 𝑁. Then\\nwe introduce in Sec. 5.2 the learning-based method which given an\\n𝑁, immediately predicts a good batch size.\\n5.1\\nDynamically Determining the Number of\\nGroups N\\nWithout loss of generality, we use one group attention module as\\nan example to show how RITA automatically gets an appropriate 𝑁.\\nThe adaptive scheduler of RITA starts with a large 𝑁and decreases\\nit dynamically. This is because in the training process of RITA, the\\nfeature embeddings produced epoch by epoch tend to get stabler\\nand stabler and gradually converge, thus no need to increase 𝑁.\\nRITA reduces the number of groups by merging similar groups.\\nIntuitively, given two groups, we could measure their similarity\\nbased on the distance of their centers. If the distance between\\ntheir centers is smaller than a distance threshold, then the two\\ngroups could be merged. However, setting an appropriate distance\\nthreshold seems hard – as difficult as setting an appropriate 𝑁.\\nTo solve this problem, RITA leverages the error bound of group\\nattention introduced in Sec. 4.3. It only requires users to set an\\nerror bound 𝜖, and then uses Lemma 1 to translate 𝜖to a distance\\nthreshold 𝑑. RITA then uses Lemma 2 to determine if merging some\\ngiven clusters still meets the error bound threshold 𝜖.\\nLemma 2. Denote 𝑐𝑘to be the cluster center of 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘. Assume\\nthe existing grouping satisfies ∀k,\\nmax\\nx∈clusterk\\n|ck −x| ≤d , thus satis-\\nfying an error bound 𝜖by Lemma 1. If there exist 𝑚clusters, namely,\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘2, ...,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑚, satisfying that:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑘𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑘𝑖−𝑐𝑘𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑘𝑖| ≤𝑑,𝑖, 𝑗∈[1,𝑚]\\n(4)\\nmerging them into one cluster still meets the error bound 𝜖.\\nPlease refer to Appendix A.6 for the proof.\\nFinding the Mergable Clusters. We formulate the problem of\\nfinding mergeable clusters using graph theory:\\n(1) each cluster is a node in the graph;\\n(2) if 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑, and\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖|+|𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\nthere is an undirected edge between 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑖and 𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑗;\\nIn this scenario, finding the maximum number of mergeable\\nclusters is equivalent to finding the minimal clique cover in the\\ncorresponding graph, which is an NP-hard problem [24]. Such\\nheavy computation overhead is not acceptable for RITA. We thus\\noffer a simplified solution:\\n(1) Halve the clusters into two sets 𝑆1,𝑆2;\\n(2) If 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1 and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗∈𝑆2 satisfy:\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖\\n|𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑖| ≤𝑑,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗\\n|𝑐𝑗−𝑐𝑖| + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗| ≤𝑑\\n2\\n(5)\\n𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗is marked.\\n(3) Decrease the number of clusters by counting the masks in 𝑆2.\\nIn this solution, clusters in 𝑆1 can be regarded as transfer nodes.\\nIf (5) holds for (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1 ∈𝑆2) and (𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖∈\\n𝑆1,𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗2 ∈𝑆2), respectively, we have,\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 |\\n≤\\n𝑚𝑎𝑥\\n𝑥∈𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑗1\\n|𝑐𝑗1 −𝑐𝑖| + |𝑐𝑖−𝑐𝑗2 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗1 | + |𝑥−𝑐𝑗2 | ≤𝑑\\n(6)\\nThus (4) holds when merging several clusters in 𝑆2 with one\\ncluster in 𝑆1. As a result, we can greedily merge clusters in 𝑆2, as\\nillustrated in step(3).\\nAssume the number of clusters decreases by 𝐷after merging,\\nwe apply a momentum update [42] on the number of clusters 𝑁, as\\nis commonly used in machine learning to smooth the changing of\\n𝑁and avoid sample selection bias. To be specific: 𝑁𝑛𝑒𝑤= 𝛼(𝑁−\\n𝐷) + (1 −𝛼)𝑁, where 𝛼is a hyper-parameter for momentum.\\n5\\n5.2\\nDynamically Determining the Batch Size\\nBecause of the dynamic grouping operation, the computational\\ngraph in deep learning training [1] varies from sample to sample. As\\na result, it is impossible to precisely compute a batch’s GPU memory\\nusage without indeed feeding it into the model. To overcome this\\nproblem, RITA learns a batch size prediction function offline; then\\nat the RITA training time, given a number of groups 𝑁, RITA uses\\nthis function to predict a proper batch size.\\nWhen the model architecture and hardware are fixed, the batch\\nsize depends on the length of the timeseries 𝐿and the average\\ngroup number among all attention module 𝑁. So RITA samples\\nseveral (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs and estimate a proper batch size for each pair.\\nMore specifically, given a user-defined timeseries maximal length\\n𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, we randomly sample integral points (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) from plane\\n{1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}. Then we use a binary search based\\nalgorithm to find the maximal batch size 𝐵𝑖that consumes less than\\n90% available GPU memory, aiming to avoid wasting GPU memory\\nand the risks of out of memory (OOM).\\nTreating these pairs as ground truth labels, we use function\\nfitting [18] to learn the batch size predicting function B = f (L, N),\\nwhere B is a function of two variables 𝐿and 𝑁.\\nLearning the Prediction Function. We apply curve fit from\\nSciPy [53] as the function fitting tool to fit the two-variable function\\n𝐵𝑖= 𝑓(𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) on plane {1 ≤𝐿≤𝐿𝑚𝑎𝑥, 1 ≤𝑁≤𝐿}.\\nWe observe that applying one function to the whole plane incurs\\na huge estimation error. So we develop a dynamic-programming\\n(DP) method to divide the plane into several sub-planes and apply\\na distinct function to each sub-plane respectively. It is optimal in\\nminimizing the total estimation error on all sub-planes\\nWith the learned prediction function 𝑓, we can estimate a proper\\nbatch size for any (𝐿, 𝑁) during training, even if it is not seen in\\nthe sampled (𝐿𝑖, 𝑁𝑖) pairs.\\nThe Algorithms and Optimality Proof. Please refer to Appen-\\ndix A.3 for the pseudo code of the binary search-based algorithm\\nand the description of the DP method for plane-division and the\\nproof for its optimality.\\n6\\nEVALUATION\\nOur experimental study focuses on the following questions:\\n1. Effectiveness and efficiency of RITA: How does RITA com-\\npare with other Transformer-based methods and traditional time-\\nseries representation learning methods in accuracy and efficiency?\\n2. Ablation Study: How do the key techniques of RITA work?\\n6.1\\nExperimental Setup\\nDatasets. We evaluate RITA on classification and imputation tasks\\nusing 5 multi-variate and 3 uni-variate timeseries datasets.\\n• WISDM [55] is a popular multivariate timeseries dataset gen-\\nerated from the accelerometer in the mobile phone. The subjects\\nperformed 18 daily activities (e.g. walking, jogging). The dataset\\nwas collected from 51 subjects and the sampling rate is 20 Hz.\\n• HHAR dataset [46] contains sensing data of accelerometer col-\\nlected from 9 users performing 5 activities with 12 different smart-\\nphones (varying in sampling rate). This increases the complexity\\nof the task and thus can test the model’s robustness.\\n• RWHAR RealWorld HAR dataset [48] covers 15 subjects per-\\nforming 8 locomotion-style activities. Each subject wears the sen-\\nsors for approximately ten minutes. The sampling rate is 50 Hz.\\n• ECG dataset [34] consists of 10,000 EEG recordings for arrhyth-\\nmia classification. Each recording has an uncertain length ranging\\nfrom 6 to 60 seconds sampled at 500 Hz. The ECG recordings corre-\\nspond to 9 types of heart problems such as atrial fibrillation (AF)\\nand premature atrial contraction (PAC), etc.\\n• MGH [6] is a EEG dataset collected by Mass. General Hospital.\\nEach timeseries corresponds to the EEG data observed from one\\npatient during their stay in ICU for a couple of days. The EEG\\nmonitoring produced data with 20 channels. The sampling rate is\\n200 HZ. So it produces very long timeseries.\\n• WISDM*/HHAR*/RWHAR* are three uni-variate datasets de-\\nrived by picking one channel from WISDM/HHAR/RWHAR.\\nTraining/Validation Data Generation. We apply a sliding win-\\ndow on the raw timeseries to get training/validation samples. The\\nsize of the sliding window is set as 200 on small datasets (WISDM,\\nHHAR, RWHAR), 2000 on medium size dataset (ECG), and 10,000\\non the large dataset (MGH). Table 1 shows the statics of the gen-\\nerated datasets. They are randomly split into training/validation\\nset in a proportion of 0.9/0.1. In “pretraining + few-label finetun-\\ning” scenario, we use 100 labeled data per class for finetuning. We\\nguarantee that training set does not overlap with the validation set.\\nDataset\\nTrain.

We compare RITA against the SOTA Trans-\\nformer based timeseries representation learning method TST [61].\\nTo evaluate our group attention (referred to as Group Attn.), we\\ndevelop three baselines by replacing the group attention compo-\\nnent in RITA with the classic vanilla Self-Attention [52](referred\\nto as Vanilla) and two SOTA methods that reduce the complexity\\nof self-attention by approximation in NLP, namely, Performer [10]\\n(referred to as Performer) and Linformer [54] (referred to as Lin-\\nformer). Similar to our proposed Group Attn., Vanilla, Performer,\\nLinformer all use RITA’s time-aware convolution operation (Sec. 3)\\nto turn timeseries segments into input feature vectors.\\nWe also compare Group Attn. against GRAIL [40], which is\\nthe SOTA of the non-deep learning methods for timeseries repre-\\nsentation learning. GRAIL supports classification tasks by feeding\\nthe learned representations into a Support-Vector Machine [12]\\nor K-Nearest Neighbor [17] classifier. Note GRAIL only targets\\nuni-variate timeseries and cannot support imputation tasks.\\nMethodology. We mainly focus on two downstream tasks:\\n(1) Classification. First, we train Group Attn. and the base-\\nlines with full labels from scratch to test the effectiveness of RITA\\nframework and the approximation quality of our group attention.\\nSecond, to measure the effectiveness of self-supervised pretrain-\\ning, we evaluate the accuracy of training on few labeled timeseries\\nwith/without pretraining on large scales of unlabeled timeseries. To\\nbe specific, we split the training set into a pretraining set and a fine-\\ntuning set, with very few data in the latter (100 labeled samples per\\n6\\n(a) Effectiveness \\n(b) Efficiency\\nTraining Time/sec\\nFigure 3: Full-label classification results (multi-variate data).\\nclass in our experiment). We train the model on the cloze pretrain-\\ning task with a mask rate 𝑝= 0.2. Then we train two classification\\nmodels using the finetuning set, either based on the pretrained\\nversion or from scratch. We repeat the experiment 5 times with\\nrandom data splits and report the median accuracy.\\n(2) Imputation. We run the imputation task on the datasets used\\nin classification as well as the large unlabeled MGH dataset, and\\nmeasure the mean square error and absolute imputation error. To\\nget timeseries with missing values, we randomly mask the values\\nwith an expected mask rate of 𝑝= 0.2. The masked values are\\nreplaced with a special value.\\nFinally, to evaluate Group Attn.’s benefit on efficiency, the total\\ntime of forward computation, backward propagation, and grouping\\nare measured for all methods in all the experiments.\\nTo save space, we only report the average training time per epoch\\nhere and refer readers to Appendix A.8 for the inference time.\\nWe first compare against the Transformer-based methods on\\nmulti-variate datasets (sec. 6.2, 6.3), then compare against the non-\\ndeep learning method GRAIL on uni-variate datasets (sec. 6.4).\\nConfiguration. Please refer to Appendix A.1 for the experiment\\nconfiguration and hyper-parameter settings.\\n6.2\\nEffectiveness: Transformer-Based Methods\\nWe first evaluate the quality of the models trained with full labels\\nfrom scratch. We then show how the pretraining of RITA increases\\nthe accuracy of the downstream tasks.\\n6.2.1\\nfull-label training (Multi-variate classification)\\nResults shown in Figure 3(a) get us the following observations:\\n(1) RITA’s advantage over TST. On all four datasets for the clas-\\nsification tasks, Group Attn. and the other three baselines that use\\nRITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and Linformer) outperform\\nTST. In particular, Group Attn. outperforms TST by 49 percentage\\npoints on the ECG dataset (88.48% vs 39.93%) with long timeseries.\\nTwo deficiencies in TST may cause its poor performance on the long\\ntimeseries. Firstly, TST concatenates the output embedding vector\\nof each time stamp, then uses a linear classifier to do classification\\non the concatenated vector. When the timeseries is long, the linear\\nclassifier has so many parameters that it tends to overfit easily.\\nSecondly, TST replaces Layer Normalization in vanilla Transformer\\nwith Batch Normalization. When the timeseries is long, it can only\\naccommodate a small number of timeseries in each batch, leading\\nto bias in Batch Normalization.\\n(2) Group-attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on\\n3 out of 4 datasets for classification. Although Linformer works\\nslightly better than Group Attn. on the ECG dataset (90.37% vs\\n88.84%), its performance is the worst in all other cases compared\\nto any other RITA-based methods. Vanilla computes the attention\\nscores precisely. Thus it is expected to work well. However, Group\\nAttn. outperforms Vanilla on WISDM (87.50% vs 86.95%) and is very\\nclose to it on other 3 datasets. This suggests that group attention’s\\napproximation quality is good.\\n6.2.2\\npretraining + few label finetune (Multi-variate classification)\\nThe results shown in Table 3 get us the following observation:\\n(1) Pretraining is effective. Pretraining always leads to better\\naccuracy than training with a few labels from scratch. In particular,\\non WISDM data all the methods using RITA architecture increase\\nthe accuracy by at least 10%. This is impressive considering we do\\nnot have a very large unlabeled pre-training set to use.\\n(2) RITA’s advantage over TST. our Group Attn. and other\\nthree baselines using RITA architecture (Vanilla, Performer, and\\nLinformer) significantly outperform TST on all four classification\\ndatasets by 25 percentage points.\\n(3) Group Attention’s advantage over other attention mech-\\nanisms. Group Attn. is better than Performer and Linformer on 3\\nout of 4 datasets. When compared to Vanilla, Group Attn. is better\\non HHAR and ECG, and comparable on the other two, further con-\\nfirming its high quality on approximation. Further, we notice that\\nLinformer struggles in this setting: in average its accuracy is worse\\nthan Vanilla by 8.22% and Group Attn. by 8.01%. This is because the\\nlow-rank projection operation introduces extra model parameters,\\nmaking Linformer more easily overfit, while overfitting is especially\\nharmful when there are only a few labeled training samples.\\n6.2.3\\nfull-dataset training (Multi-variate imputation)\\nSimilar to classification tasks, the results of imputation tasks\\n(Table.2) show that Group Attn. consistently outperforms the base-\\nlines in training time while achieving comparable/better MSE. Again,\\non the large dataset MGH (length = 10,000), TST and Vanilla fail due\\nto out of memory (OOM) errors. Methods using RITA framework\\n(Group Attn., Performer, Linformer) all achieve very low MSE (are\\nhighly accurate). Among them Linformer is the worst.\\n6.3\\nEfficiency: Transformer-based Methods\\nWe measure the efficiency by the average training time per epoch\\nincluding the cost of the forward computation + backward propaga-\\ntion and the grouping overhead. We first show the results on all the\\n5 datasets in Sec. 6.3.1. We then vary the length of the timeseries\\non the MGH dataset to show group attention’s scalability on long\\ntimeseries in Sec. 6.3.2.\\n6.3.1\\nTraining Time: All Multi-variate Datasets\\nThe results in Fig. 3(b) and Table 2 lead to the below observations:\\n(1) Vanilla Self-Attention is not scalable. In average, it takes\\n2-3 minutes to train one epoch when the length of the timeseries is\\nonly 200 (WISDM, HHAR, RWHAR), takes over 15 minutes when\\nthe length increases to 2,000 (ECG), and fails on the long MGH data\\nwhen the length reaches 10,000 due to out of GPU memory.\\n(2) Group Attn.’s advantage over all other attention mecha-\\nnisms. As we have shown in Sec. 6.2, Group Attn. is more accurate\\n7\\nDataset\\nLength\\nTST [61]\\nVanilla\\nPerformer\\nLinformer\\nGroup Attn.\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nMSE\\nTime/s\\nWISDM\\n200\\n13.30\\n150.3\\n3.240\\n178.1\\n3.449\\n162.6\\n3.852\\n141.9\\n3.277\\n136.7\\nHHAR\\n200\\n1.085\\n78.2\\n0.2968\\n97.4\\n0.2980\\n82.6\\n0.3198\\n81.1\\n0.2974\\n73.3\\nRWHAR\\n200\\n0.0882\\n83.9\\n0.0478\\n108.1\\n0.0489\\n89.1\\n0.0572\\n98.4\\n0.0478\\n81.3\\nECG\\n2000\\n0.0905\\n696.3\\n0.0037\\n857.9\\n0.0033\\n270.2\\n0.0035\\n291.38\\n0.0038\\n164.36\\nMGH\\n10000\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\n0.00014\\n356.2\\n0.00088\\n404.9\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nTable 2: Imputation results (multi-variate data).

Moreover, thanks\\nto the GPU-friendly design of RITA, it is at least 2× faster than\\nGRAIL in training time.\\n6.5\\nAblation Study\\n6.5.1\\nAdaptive Scheduler\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RITA’s adaptive scheduler (Sec. 5),\\nwe compare it against a baseline using a fixed group number 𝑁. We\\nvary 𝑁and the error bound threshold 𝜖used by RITA.\\nFrom the results in Table 4 we get the following observations:\\n(1) Adaptive Scheduler is better than fixed 𝑁. Training with\\nAdaptive Scheduler already achieves better or comparable perfor-\\nmance compared to the best performing 𝑁. More specifically, on\\nthe MGH dataset, dynamic scheduler always achieves better accu-\\nracy and is much faster compared to fixed 𝑁. On the ECG dataset,\\nalthough fixed 𝑁is slightly better than adaptive scheduler in accu-\\nracy when setting the N as 512, it runs much slower than adaptive\\nscheduler. Of course, finding the best 𝑁that balances the accuracy\\nand running time requires careful tuning.\\n(2) Adaptive Scheduler is tuning free. It is robust on both\\naccuracy and running time when 𝜖varies, while the results of\\nfixed 𝑁vary significantly when the value of 𝑁changes. Therefore,\\nAdaptive Scheduler frees the users from tuning the 𝜖threshold,\\nwhile it is hard to find an appropriate 𝑁for a given dataset.\\n8\\nDataset\\nTask\\nScheduler\\nParameter\\nMetric\\nTime\\nECG\\nClass.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n88.34%\\n292.5\\n2\\n88.48%\\n236.8\\n3\\n87.83%\\n216.8\\nFixed\\n64\\n87.50%\\n255.2\\n128\\n88.96%\\n297.2\\n256\\n88.82%\\n414.1\\n512\\n90.03%\\n662.6\\n1024\\n88.65%\\n873.7\\nMGH\\nImput.\\nDynamic\\n1.5\\n0.00041\\n60.7\\n2\\n0.00040\\n57.9\\n3\\n0.00042\\n54.4\\nFixed\\n128\\n0.00054\\n128.6\\n256\\n0.00053\\n190.2\\n512\\n0.00049\\n240.8\\n1024\\n0.00046\\n323.3\\nTable 4: Adaptive Scheduling VS Fixed N.\\nPretrain Data size\\nFew-label Accuracy\\nN/A\\n62.56%\\n12,446\\n72.94%\\n24,892\\n72.78%\\n37,338\\n74.10%\\n49,784\\n74.22%\\n62,231\\n75.06%\\nTable 5: RITA Pretraining: increasing sizes of pretrain set.\\n6.5.2\\nThe Sizes of the Pretraining Data\\nNext, we evaluate how the number of unlabeled data influences the\\neffectiveness of pretraining. To get empirical results, we pretrain\\nRITA on WISDM dataset with 20%/40%/60%/80% of the pretraining\\ndata and finetune each pretrained model with 100 labels per class.\\nThe results in Table 5 show that: (1) The more pretraining data,\\nthe larger the improvement. The accuracy increases with the\\nsizes of the pretraining data; (2) Marginal utility diminishing.\\nThe first 20% pretraining data gives a 10.38% improvement in accu-\\nracy (72.94% vs 62.56%), while the remaining 80% pretraining data\\nonly gives an additional improvement of 2.12% (75.06% vs 72.94%).\\n7\\nRELATED WORK\\n7.1\\nTimeseries Analytics\\nThere is a great deal of prior work on timeseries analytics methods.\\nThis work can be divided into three categories: (1) non-deep learn-\\ning methods; (2) CNN/RNN-based deep learning methods; and (3)\\nTransformer-based deep learning methods.\\nTraditional Methods. These methods, such as TS-CHIEF [45],\\nHIVE-COTE [33], ROCKET [15] have achieved notable performance\\non public datasets. Despite that, traditional methods suffer from\\none or more issues: they (1) rely on expert knowledge for feature\\nextraction; (2) incur heavy computation cost and are inappropriate\\nfor GPU devices; (3) support only uni-variate timeseries; (4) perform\\nclassification solely. Some work [61] shows that the transformed-\\nbased methods outperform these traditional methods especially on\\nmulti-variate timeseries.\\nIn particular, as the SOTA of timeseries representation learn-\\ning, GRAIL [40] extracts landmarks from data and computes the\\nrepresentations with the combination of the landmarks. However,\\nGRAIL only supports uni-variate timeseries. Our experiments (Sec. 6.4)\\nshow that RITA significantly outperforms GRAIL in both effective-\\nness and efficiency on uni-variate timeseries.\\nCNN/RNN-based Deep Learning Methods. CNN-based methods,\\nsuch as InceptionTime [21] and Resnet [19], are good at classifica-\\ntion tasks, but can not handle generative tasks such as forecasting\\nbecause of the inductive bias of convolution networks. RNN-based\\nmethods, such as Brit [7] and deepAR [44], are capable for classifi-\\ncation, regression and generation. However, the recurrent structure\\nbrings a lot of problems: (1) limiting the model’s ability in captur-\\ning long-range correlation; (2) notoriously difficult to train [41]\\nbecause of gradient vanishing and exploding problem. As a result,\\nsuch methods can hardly scale to very long timeseries.\\nTransformer-based Deep Learning Methods. Given that Trans-\\nformer is the best choice for backbone in almost all sequence mod-\\neling tasks, some effort has been made to apply Transformer to\\ntimeseries analytics. Targeting forecasting of uni-variate timeseries,\\nLogTrans [30] introduced a log sparsity assumption to attention\\ncomputation. Informer [62] pushes LogTrans a step further and\\nscales forecasting to multi-variate timeseries. Autoformer [57] per-\\nforms forecasting by decomposing timeseries into two parts, i.e.\\nthe trend part and the seasonal part.\\nFor imputation tasks, CDSA [37] outperforms statistical meth-\\nods and the SOTA of RNN-based method Brit [7] on 3 public and\\n2 competition datasets. For timeseries classification, AutoTrans-\\nformer [43] performs architecture search to adapt to the tasks\\nin different domains. For timeseries anomaly detection, Anomaly\\nTransformer [58] outperforms many widely-used methods such\\nas OmniAnomaly [47], assuming the attention score maps show\\nGaussian distribution.\\nAll of these works are designed for specific tasks, rather than\\nfunctioning as a representation learning framework to serve\\ndifferent downstream tasks. To fill this gap, some researchers pro-\\nposed a Transformer-based architecture, called TST [61]. Like RITA,\\nTST supports regression, classification, and unsupervised learning\\nthrough the “cloze test” pretraining task on timeseries. However,\\nTST directly uses the classical Vanilla self-attention, thus not scal-\\nable to long timeseries as shown in our experiments (Sec. 6.3.2).\\n7.2\\nEfficient Transformers\\nThe need of improving the scalability of Transformers has led to\\nmore efficient variations of Transformers, especially for accommo-\\ndating long text data in NLP [49].\\nIntroducing fixed/random patterns to self-attention mechanism\\nis an intuitive idea. Sparse Transformer [9] and Longformer [3] only\\ncompute attention at fixed intervals. ETC [2] and BigBird [60] use\\nglobal-local attention: the attention computation is limited within\\na fixed radius, while some auxiliary tokens are added to attend/get\\nattended globally. The deficiencies of fixed attention patterns are\\nobvious: it heavily depends on users to give an optimal setting.\\nTo decrease the reliance on human labor, some works seek to\\nintroduce learnable/adaptive attention patterns instead of fixed\\npatterns. Reformer [26] proposed only computing the dominant\\nattention terms based on their observation of sparsity in atten-\\ntion matrix from language/image data. Such sparsity is intuitive\\nin language data, in which a word’s attention mainly focuses on\\nthe nearby sentences. However, attention in timeseries data shows\\nstrong seasonal patterns rather than sparse patterns, mainly as\\n9\\nresult of the periodicity of timeseries data. Therefore, such works\\ndo not work well for timeseries.\\nApart from introducing attention patterns, some works seek\\nto solve this problem with applied mathematics techniques. Lin-\\nformer [54] performs a projection to decrease the size of query,\\nkey and value matrices before attention computation, because the\\nattention matrix tends to be low-ranked. Performer [10] uses linear\\nfunctions to approximate the kernel function softmax, making at-\\ntention computation commutative. When the sequence length is far\\ngreater than the dimension of embedding vectors, Performer ben-\\nefits from changing the order of matrix multiplication. Linformer\\nand Performer do not depend on the unique properties of language\\ndata, thus potentially fitting timeseries better than other techniques,\\nwhich is why we compared against them in our experiments. How-\\never as shown in Sec. 6, our group attention significantly outper-\\nforms them in both accuracy and efficiency (training time), because\\ngroup attention fully leverages the periodicity of timeseries.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we presented RITA, an automatic, self-supervised, and\\nscalable timeseries analytics tool. RITA effectively adapts Trans-\\nformer, popular in NLP, into timeseries analytics. As the key com-\\nponent of RITA, group attention eliminates the performance bottle-\\nneck of the classical self-attention mechanisms, thus successfully\\nscaling RITA to highly complex, long timeseries data. Our experi-\\nments confirm that RITA significantly speeds up the state-of-the-art\\nby 63X with a better accuracy.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Martín Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen,\\nCraig Citro, Greg S Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, et al.\\n2016.

All models were trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100\\n16GB GPU. All the methods are optimized with AdamW [36] of\\nwhich the starting learning rate and weight decay parameter are\\nboth 1𝑒−4. In full-label training scenario, we train the models for\\n100 epochs. In “pretraining + few-label finetuning scenario”, as the\\npretrained models require fewer epochs to converge [61], we train\\nthe model for 50 epochs.

Other unsupervised\\ntasks such as similarity search or clustering are naturally supported\\nby extracting feature embeddings from RITA.\\nA.7.1\\nClassification\\nTo classify timeseries, we input timeseries to the model as described\\nin Sec. 3 and attach a special token [CLS] as the first input em-\\nbedding. [CLS]’s embedding acts as the embedding for the entire\\ntimeseries, and the output representation of [CLS] is fed into a\\nclassifier: y = Softmax(WclsZ[CLS] + Bcls), where 𝑍[𝐶𝐿𝑆] ∈R𝑑is\\nthe output representation of [CLS], C is the number of classes, and\\nWcls ∈RC×d, Bcls ∈RC are learnable parameters for classification\\ntask. The result vector 𝑦∈R𝐶represents the possibility that the\\ninput timeseries belongs to each class.\\nWe apply Cross Entropy Loss as the loss function of the classi-\\nfication task [13]: L = 1\\nC\\nÍC\\ni=1 −ˆy(i)log(y(i)), where ˆ𝑦is a binary\\nindicator for ground truth label:\\nˆ𝑦(𝑖) =\\n(\\n1\\n𝑖is ground truth label\\n0\\n𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒\\n(16)\\nA.7.2\\nImputation\\nTimeseries are mainly generated by sensors, a common problem\\nof which is missing values.

We scale the values of all timeseries to non-negative\\nand use a special value (-1) to indicate missing values:\\n𝑇𝑜(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n−1\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝑀\\n𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n(𝑖, 𝑗) ∉𝑀\\n(17)\\n𝑇𝑜is fed into the RITA as input, and the output representa-\\ntions are concatenated and fed into a Transpose Convolution layer\\nwhich decodes the output embedding vectors from hidden space to\\ntimeseries values, corresponding to the convolution operation in\\n13\\nthe input stage, i.e., Y = TransposeCNN (Z1 +○Z2 +○... +○Zn), where\\n𝑌∈R𝑡×𝑚is the recovered timeseries, and 𝑍𝑖∈R𝑑is the output of\\neach position.\\nHere Mean Square Error is chosen as the loss function [51]:\\n𝐿=\\n1\\n|𝑀|\\nÍ\\n(𝑖,𝑗)∈𝑀(𝑌(𝑖, 𝑗) −𝑇𝑟(𝑖, 𝑗))2.\\nA.7.3\\nForecasting\\nForecasting can be regarded as a special case of imputation, in\\nwhich all missing values are at the end of timeseries.\\nSo like in imputation task, we scale the timeseries to non-\\nnegative and use a special value (-1) to indicate the values to be\\npredicted:\\n𝑇𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑(𝑖, 𝑗) =\\n(\\n𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙(𝑖, 𝑗)\\n𝑖≤𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑\\n−1\\n𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒\\n(18)\\nWhere 𝑡𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑is the observed timestamp.

       "  Document(metadata={'source': 'Wikipedia', 'title': 'Attention is all you need'}, page_content='Page: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\\nAs of 2024, the paper has been cited more than 140,000 times.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryōsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Love\\nSummary: \"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967, with \"Baby, You\\'re a Rich Man\" as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain\\'s contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were shown performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon\\'s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show\\'s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture\\'s embrace of flower power philosophy.\\nOur World coincide'),\n",

       "'The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\nWe address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image\\nretrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular\\napproaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms,\\nwhich are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There\\nare different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of\\nthe feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied\\n(spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two\\nforms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,\\ndetection or retrieval.\\n  We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end\\nof a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and\\nglobal, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial\\npooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global\\ndescriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of\\nattention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\nTimeseries analytics is of great importance in many real-world applications.\\nRecently, the Transformer model, popular in natural language processing, has\\nbeen leveraged to learn high quality feature embeddings from timeseries, core\\nto the performance of various timeseries analytics tasks. However, the\\nquadratic time and space complexities limit Transformers\\' scalability,\\nespecially for long timeseries. To address these issues, we develop a\\ntimeseries analytics tool, RITA, which uses a novel attention mechanism, named\\ngroup attention, to address this scalability issue. Group attention dynamically\\nclusters the objects based on their similarity into a small number of groups\\nand approximately computes the attention at the coarse group granularity. It\\nthus significantly reduces the time and space complexity, yet provides a\\ntheoretical guarantee on the quality of the computed attention. The dynamic\\nscheduler of RITA continuously adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nin the training process, ensuring group attention always uses the fewest groups\\nneeded to meet the approximation quality requirement. Extensive experiments on\\nvarious timeseries datasets and analytics tasks demonstrate that RITA\\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and is significantly faster --\\nwith speedups of up to 63X.\\nPage: Attention Is All You Need\\nSummary: \"Attention Is All You Need\" is a 2017 landmark research paper in machine learning authored by eight scientists working at Google. The paper introduced a new deep learning architecture known as the transformer, based on the attention mechanism proposed in 2014 by Bahdanau et al. It is considered a foundational paper in modern artificial intelligence, as the transformer approach has become the main architecture of large language models like those based on GPT. At the time, the focus of the research was on improving Seq2seq techniques for machine translation, but the authors go further in the paper, foreseeing the technique\\'s potential for other tasks like question answering and what is now known as multimodal Generative AI.\\nThe paper\\'s title is a reference to the song \"All You Need Is Love\" by the Beatles. The name \"Transformer\" was picked because Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the paper\\'s authors, liked the sound of that word.\\nAn early design document was titled \"Transformers: Iterative Self-Attention and Processing for Various Tasks\", and included an illustration of six characters from the Transformers animated show. The team was named Team Transformer.\\nSome early examples that the team tried their Transformer architecture on included English-to-German translation, generating Wikipedia articles on \"The Transformer\", and parsing. These convinced the team that the Transformer is a general purpose language model, and not just good for translation.\\nAs of 2024, the paper has been cited more than 140,000 times.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Kill\\nSummary: All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese science fiction light novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka with illustrations by Yoshitoshi Abe. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills.\\nA manga adaptation, written by Ryōsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha\\'s Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A separate graphic novel adaptation, written by Nick Mamatas and illustrated by Lee Ferguson, was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released in May 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title.\\nThe novel was Sakurazaka\\'s breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Chōhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Best Japanese Long Work in the 36th Seiun Awards in 2005.\\n\\nPage: All You Need Is Love\\nSummary: \"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967, with \"Baby, You\\'re a Rich Man\" as its B-side. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The song was Britain\\'s contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were shown performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon\\'s lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for broad appeal to the show\\'s international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture\\'s embrace of flower power philosophy.\\nOur World coincide\\nIn just 3 minutes help us improve arXiv: cs arXiv:2501.05730v1 arXiv author ID The next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining the competitive performance of SA while achieving low-cost inference and efficient long-sequence training, primarily focuses on three approaches: linear attention, linear RNNs, and state space models.
